Then she was in a kitchen with a bunch of pie crust and I was asking her if I could help her, but she said no and she was very nice. In real life she 's young with longer dark hair, but in the dream it seems like she looked like a character on The Young and the Restless who also fits that description. I woke up before she got the pies baked because the phone rang."
12812L,"I don't remember the first part, but in the last part a friend was telling me that we were due at the airport in a couple of hours. I asked why and he said vacation. I had totally forgotten. I was trying to throw things in a suitcase and trying to get hold of a cat sitter, total confusion. I was saying that I could never make it in time, he was trying to help me pack, but I would never have had enough if it had been in reality. I woke up because the phone rang."

2353L,Many nightmares that woke me up. One featured the clown from IT walking into my house to come kill me.
323L,"I was in Duluth, MN (but not really Duluth) where my Nana lived, and knew I needed to drive to her house (she might have been alive in the dream, but she died when I was 16). My dad warned me that I would need extra time to get to her house, and somehow instead of using technology to help me get to her house (I don't think I had a phone in the dream; my uncle had bought my Nana's house from his siblings after her death, but ultimately after having moved to France in 2009 and having issues repaying the mortgage, the house was sold to strangers late last year - my dad drove past the house in real life a couple weeks ago) I went to the church my Nana used to attend (it wasn't really her church) as though it would help me get there. I spent time in the church, spoke with the choir (I don't know anyone who currently attends the church), went up to a second or third story level via a narrow side staircase (that I don't believe exists in real life) and ended up I'm a room where there were lots of kids in a room about to watch a movie (maybe for Bible school?). I left that room and it only seemed to be then that I realized that I could find my Nana's house by using the cross streets (even at this point in the dream I couldn't remember how to get there, even though I've driven and been driven to her house as an adult), and I felt better about the fact that I'd be arriving late because I'd gotten lost and stopped at the church (where I don't recall asking anyone for directions). I might have made it to her house, but I'm not sure; if I did, it wasn't really her house. Next I recall being in a store with my mom where they sold keychains that said something like No, Never, Not One More (in English and Not-Spanish that was meant to be Spanish; I last took Spanish when K was 10 and don't speak it). The message was supposed to be about making sure no one else is raped / abused (I was watching Law & Order SVU before bed, and one of the episodes was about a group of Hispanic teenage girls who were raped - two by their father, one by her father figure). A young adult guy had had a similar keychain in the upper movie room with the kids (I think he was a counselor, I don't know who he was, when I first say the keychain I'd thought it was just a cool fashion accessory, I couldn't read it until the store). I woke up, and don't know if ai bought a keychain of my own in the dream."
483L,"I was working with some friends on a work project (we don't actually work together) that involved something about needing additional information. There was something wrong with my friend / dream coworker's car, so her husband (the real life friend in question is unmarried and single) did something to fix it that involved putting what looked like a piece of charcoal wrapped in something metallic in the car, and we needed to drive for about 10 minutes to charge up the car. We went to a nearby elementary school (in real life, I volunteered at a nearby elementary school that closed for at least a few weeks due to COVID-19; also three of my cousins are teachers and the decision was made within the past 24 hours that their districts l will not re-open this school year) where we got the info but didn't end up bringing a chair (that looked just like my kitchen chairs, my real life work from home area is set up at my kitchen table) back with us. When we got back, we were at my kitchen table / work from he station but not really there and something about different makeup face/eyeshadow brushes, some of which looked like they'd been used in something reddish-orange (in a shade I used to have in a lip tint), some in more of a mauve. The electronic medical records summary we'd received for work included an unadmitted psychiatric condition, so we needed to order the full medical records (a real life work guideline). Someone (not me) was wearing a black dress with tiny white polka dots."
753L,"I was with a couple of friends and at one point the mother of one of them joined in in the conversation (I don't recall the subject). Later I spent the night with two friends (one was the same from earlier) who were roommates in this huge house (where neither of them live in real life), a huge place that could've been spooky if not for the presence of friends and the warm, yellow-ish light bulbs. I had packed a lot of things with me (MN just received a stay home order yesterday that's effective Friday), and brought my real-life small terrarium (three small succulents atop a moss, I've had it since last summer, but the succulent closest to the front of the container has increasingly been looking like it's dying vs. just having one or two sections looking like they were dried out, despite me having increased my watering since I've been home more; the moss in real life is more brown than green - my apartment is super dry + though the two succulents at the back of the container have always appeared healthy). My friends were happy to have me stay (move in?) with them, and I think I was still able to go into work. Something happened to the terranium and the moss went from taking yo half of the container to almost the entire thing (not sure if the succulents were still in there) but the moss was now purplish, which my friends and I interpreted as meaning it was all healthy again. We took the terranium with and went swimming with it in the ocean, trying to hold it above the water. My friend accidentally let the terranium go below the surface when she was swimming with the dolphins that had come up to us, and I told the terranium back, but it fell and sank to the bottom. I swam down to the bottom (the water wasn't too deep, likely 8-13ft) to retrieve it. I could see myself swimming underwater to get it,the sun made the greenish-brown water (which was clear and clean, not mucky with seaweed) glow. I think I swam with my eyes open (which I never do because I had contacts from ages 13 to 30 and swam in them). I brought the terranium up towards the surface, it was heavy, and I put it on the dock."
6572L,"I was the leader of a confirmation class (I'm not very religious) except instead of it being a class of 13 to 14-year-olds, they were people from my high school class who were college-age (this year is our 10th anniversary of college graduation). We were in a church that wasn't a church and for some reason they all had to stay there during confirmation. One of them said that they thought the stack of Bibles they needed was in one place, I said it was in another, and I felt a bit smug as I was proved right. There was a litter of puppies (old enough to be a few months past being weaned) where one puppy needed to be assigned to each confirmand, yet for some reason they all stayed in the covered box and weren't given to them yet. I also was working for my old manager and was balancing both my regular work (with a more flexible schedule and fewer hours than I have IRL) and teaching the class. The second day I realized that the puppies hadn't been fed or watered and I was so scared that they would be dead, but I pulled back the blanket and they were alive. I filled one bowel with water for them and another with some food; eventually I added some leftover pasta soup to the food bowl once it was emptied. One of the leftovers I'd set aside for the dogs, wrapped in tinfoil) was rotted - I looked inside the foil briefly and it looked like a decaying, dead bird. I didn't tell anyone about how I could have accidentally killed the puppies through starvation/dehydration, but did assign one to each confirmand. I was a witch like one put of Harry Potter, I was with two of my confirmand friends and we were walking through the busy streets that were in France but not really France and one parade was streaming up one direction and another was streaming down the other direction, and we had to walk through both groups (this felt dangerous for unclear reasons, maybe the groups would attack if we interfered with their movements?) because on the other side of the road was a p√¢tisserie that I think ai needed to go to to be able to feed the puppies again. We made it across the street and into the packed store - we went through the first room into the second, and made it to the back of the line which somehow also the place where you ordered. I wanted to take a picture of the pastries in the case but wasn't able to, even when I tried from a few angles (this was likely inspired by my phone dying without warning when I went on a walk yesterday was taking pictures, the phone was at 61% battery). It was my turn to order, and one of the confirmand's suddenly had her puppy with her but it was now a full-size dog. I tried ordering in French but the woman in the store didn't understand, she tried to offer me (in not-at-all-French-accented broken English) a large, dark, braided pecan role instead of the small choux pastry with green craquelin (the craquelin wasn't on the pastry yet, even though the Great British Bake Off has taught me that it needs to be placed on top of the dough before its baked). I was sad not to get what I wanted, but the alternative pastry looked ok, so I agreed. I was them the only person near the p√¢tisserie clerk and she told me something about the Minister of Magic and I had to go on a mission. I walked down a ramp of the store and started talking to a blond British man/wizard who listened to the equivalent of the wizarding BBC radio to be briefed. The minister wasn't listening to briefings though they were available, and was possibly a dark wizard (no doubt this was inspired by Donald Trump) I looked into the large glass window and climbed through it. The blond man and I ended up in one place and we were hoping that with another quick apparition to a third location that we could go back to the first place, but we had to trap something in a sort of expanding purple sleeping bag that could fully zip up. The creature kept expanding and we weren't sure we'd be able to finish closing it in time, but the creature's presence let us know that we were compromised and would need to apparate to more places to hide our tracks before we could return."
12222L,"I was a super hero of some sort, but in my dream I was in civilian mode, I just knew I was secretly responsible to help protect people. I spoke with a guy who might also have had powers but didn't see the need for concealment, as he scheduled an event for me with such a quick turnaround (under half an hour from my start time) that his email invite was more announcement than a true invite; it irked me. I was in a store where I knew I needed to leave early rather than later to get home so I could have the meeting in the morning. I spoke with a woman who worked there as she held a very small, fairly squirmy kitten who moved in her hands like a slinky before she put him in a cardboard box with indented cups as though made to hold many small plants. I knew there was something bad/evil about the store clerk, but I needed to escape quickly, without making a scene. Once outside, I saw two friends (who don't live in the same household) eagerly walking towards me on the sidewalk (standing right next to each other, no social distancing) to go to a movie together. I was jealous, both because their get together didn't include me, but also because I couldn't go even if I had been included (I think part of my shock to see them going to see a movie is because: 1) all theaters are closed, 2) not social distancing). I had a premonition of one of them making a post about their outing, and wishing I could have been part of that. I went back home (not anywhere I've lived IRL), and I was in a walk-in closet with a young boy who had been captured by the bad guys; in coloring and build he somewhat resembled but was not Harry Potter (last night I saw photos of a college friend's son dressed up as Harry Potter for Halloween, but this boy was not her son). I somehow left but could not take the boy with me. I was in the house and two bad guys were there, holding my family hostage. I went to one bathroom (the floor plan resembled an older-fashioned detective's office or newsroom, with stained wood doors and somewhat opaque class that ripples), peeked open the door, and saw one bad guy. He was holding a set of delicate, bulbous glass things that I somehow knew were very important, and was taking them one at a time, and squeezing in hen and flushing them down the toilet. I felt frantic, but somehow he either didn't see me, or couldn't come after me unless he finished his task first. I went to the other, adjacent bathroom, and saw the other bad guy at work on a similar task. To my horror as I opened the second door wider, the two rooms were now connected, and I could see the first bad guy too, and they were both laughing at me, triumphant (both bad guys were wearing maroon coats, which the military characters all wore in the production of Much Ado About Nothing I watched last night). They weren't coming after me, but I backed up, knowing I had to get away from them."
13160L,"I was with Sherlock Holmes and John Watson (I was watching the recent Sherlock BBC series right before bed) with a blonde friend I didn't recognize, as well as a woman who I think was my mother but she was also the housekeeper from Sherlock. Somehow we give had ended up in a scenario that was both real (in that it had actual, permanent consequences if anything bad happened) but also was a simulation (not dissimilar to Upload, another series I recently watched). We had infiltrated this alternative place that was created by someone not-good (don't know whether it was Moriarty or someone (s) else). I was with my friend and the housekeeper/my mom on a grassy hill, on the lower slope that lead down to a lake with dark, unwelcoming-looking water (not far behind us, the slope hot fairly steep). There was a woman either on the air or higher up on the hill telling us, a group of largely women lying recumbent (facing away from the water), that you could become pregnant if you wanted to be, even if you hadn't before. My blonde friend who was and wasn't also me had her stomach swell, and she and Sherlock linked hands and sound around in a circle (which both looked fun and carefree - not very like the character, in that respect - but also was somehow similar to the episode when Sherlock spun Watson around in a circle to try to improve his memory recall). Then a baby popped out of her/my stomach (like something out of Sims, not like in actual childbirth), was there for a moment, and then disappeared. Sherlock thought this was great because he both wanted to see how the baby generating thing worked but also didn't want a baby. His reaction didn't bother the rest of us, as the baby wasn't real. A couple men from the alternative place arrived and were discussing that the entire group should be how going elsewhere, but our small group knew that meant they'd found out about us and we're trying to catch us. The housekeeper was sitting on a step near a building further down the hill with the other women who weren't part of our small group and she seemed tired and/or willing to remain there to give the rest of our small group a chance to get away.  Sherlock, Watson, and I (I think I'd fully needed with my blond friend - IRL I'm a brunette, and in the series Sherlock's love interest, Irene Adler, is also a brunette vs. Watson's wife, who was blonde, but I was neither character, yet somehow also linked with Sherlock) were walking in the shallow water and rocks at the bottom of the hill trying to get into/beyond a small patch of trees to avoid detection (I don't recall feeling like my feet/legs were wet or cold from standing in the water, though in a similar IRL situation I likely would). Next we were back at our wood cabin with tall ceilings, and Sherlock and Watson were trying to figure out how to get us out of there so we could escape back to reality, because we knew there were people chasing us. The bad guys arrived, I somehow ended up on top of these very (maybe 10-12ft) high up closet, I was crawling on all fours around there, not tons of space between me and the centrally peaked (inverted V) wood paneled ceiling, and the redhead (reminiscent of the AI redheaded bellboy in Upload) stretched and was facing me menacingly from one side of the wooden closet, and so I tried to crawl away from him."
13708L,"I dreamed I was at my apartment on a weekend, but not my IRL apartment. Around 6pm I took a nap, but when I woke up, and went into the kitchen, I saw wet footprints on the floor (they only led into the apartment, not out too, yet I didn't realize the significance that that meant the person was still there while I was sleeping), and I looked up to notice that there was a new, narrow door in the wall that hasn't been there before, and the door couldn't lock from the inside, only the outside, with a latch (not a key-based lock). It crossed my mind that it was strange that I didn't hear the construction noises of a wall being cut open and a door installed while I slept, but I explained it as being further evidence of me being a deep sleeper (which I am IRL). I don't recall calling anyone for help, but a guy who looked like a younger version of the property manager of the building where I lived 3 years ago (Darren) was suddenly there with a young woman who I think was a detective, but looked like a friend of a friend of mine, Angelina. She looked around the apartment (though this whole time the lighting remained low and golden, like from the microwave light only, it didn't feel strange that neither I nor the others turned on more lights; maybe it was the cinematic quality of wet footprints in low lighting ?) and didn't find anything. She was clearly busy, and had come in to look around in an unofficial capacity as a favor to the property manager (for some reason I just have called not-Darren vs. 911? I was chatting with friends about what it would look like if we moved into a police-free state last night before bed), even after not-Darren left. That said, she went over to a desk in the middle of the living room (which I don't have IRL) and she was making notes in the light of a small lamp on that table. She seemed to be getting ready to go, and said that she assumed I was part of the building's improv theatre group (while doesn't exist IRL, though I did theatre in middle and high school - the implication was that she was part of it and would see me there), but when I answered that I wasn't, not-Angelina paused and decided to stay with me for a bit.  The scene changed, I was at someone's house, and was looking through the cupboards like I was trying to figure out if the bakeware would tell me if it was my house; it did, and it want my house. There was someone else there, though I don't think it was not-Angelina. I looked through the glass doors to the deck and saw the grill was on fire, with high flames. Two neighborhood men rushed over and started fighting the flames before I could get there, but when we opened the grill (the flames went out by the time I reached the grill), the salmon fillets inside were untouched by flames and we're actually undercooked, almost slightly smoked on the bottom layer?"

19220L,"I had a lot of choppy dreams.  In one my youngest son was little and in school again.  I was still working my old job as a Special Ed. assistant.  I was working in the resource room at school and my son came in.  I think he was only supposed to stay for a half hour but I was so happy he was there that he stayed the rest of the afternoon with me.  I walked him back to his class before dismissal.  The Special Ed. teacher and principal at our school handed me a folder of work to use for an old student that I was 1:1 with for 3 years.  She was difficult to work with and her behavior was very challenging.  One of the reasons that I took a different position at school.  Anyway, I was contemplating how I was going to work with her and keep her motivated.  Then the dream morphed into my oldest son.  He was a young teenager (he's 29 now).  He was in school also.  As we were leaving school we had to go through a rustic turn stile (sp?).  As we were weaving through I looked to my right and in the opening of the wall were weasels or some kind of rodents.  They were moving about in the wall and it was repulsive and scary.  Then we exited safely but some got down near my feet.  In another dream three of us were outside moving a big heavy something and my brother stepped in to help.  Right behind him was a big snake.  I alerted him and he held on to what we were moving but tried to kick out to scare the snake away.  It kept moving back toward him.  Finally he reached down and tried to feed a smaller snake to the big snake.  In another dream my oldest son and I went into an apartment of some guys he knew.  It was off an alley in the city and we had to climb a rickety metal stairwell that was half on.  When we got to the second floor we climbed in.  We were there for a short time and then my son realized he had to be somewhere so we left.  Then I was drinking in the city and there was a young man in a car driving sporadically.  I talked to him from the window and he had fallen asleep.  I asked him if he was ok and he said yes but he was really tired.  I told him to roll down the windows and turn the music up loud to wake himself up.  His car kept rolling down and bumping off buildings into traffic."
19505L,"I had a dream that my husband had to get a job in the city and get an apartment so he could stay there if he had late nights.  I found out he was cheating with a younger woman and I was so distraught and sad about it.  He seems so nonchalant about it and I was heartbroken because of the broken trust.  Then I had to take a class of children to the city on a field trip.  I was all alone with around 20 elementary kids and we were gathered on a grassy triangular island between busy city streets.  The kids were acting up and I couldn't find anyone to help me.  The kids were jostling around and one threw an apple. I was trying to deal with the group in a setting that wasn't safe for the kids and I was feeling really sad after hearing about my husband.  When I woke up this morning my husband said that I had been whimpering in my sleep.  Since the pandemic, a lot of my dreams occur in the city.  I don't know what city, it could be any. I have lived in cities and suburbs but for the last 30 years we've lived in a rural setting."

1160L,"Each time I woke Iwas dreaming but I can only remember bits and pieces:  1. With a friend from a few years back we were walking in a large convention center with banners across each aisle displaying drawings similar to street art. It was decided by someone that my friend had talent and we were ushered to a table to draw. My friend got to work immediately but I was stumped at what I should draw. Then instead of my friend it was my husband and I decided to draw his hands which I have always admired.  2-3. Again in a place with large groups of people. We seemed to be waiting to be allowed to go. Again. people were happy. This seemed similar to the Japanese movie we watched last night, The Hidden Fortress, in the sense that we were trying to get past a border. I had a backpack on that someone admired and he picked me up by the top of the backpack way above the crowd. He seemed embarrassed after and I felt awkward.  A lot of people were in costume, like Mardi Gras, and I decided to dress also, but it was the next day and the crowds were more somber and without costumes in the street. I felt awkward.  We were waiting in a large restaurant, waiting till we could proceed wherever we were going, and a woman I was with didn't think she was ever going to get the beer she ordered. I tried to calm her explaining that the staff is overwhelmed.   4. A diplomat was being urgently sent to Washington. He asked me to deliver some papers here. I felt awkward because he didn't ask his wife. But then he did ask her to do something and I felt relieved."

14047L,"I can see scenes from the dreams but they are difficult to describe...a classroom atmosphere, lots of people, putting together a stroller type thing for my boss but there didn't seem to be enough time although I didn't feel stressed or from hurrying; walking down the hall with a guy I knew from a long time ago and he sang a few bars and said everyone tells him he sounds like....some famous singer....and I agreed, very baritone. Lots of people everywhere."
14995L,Disturbing dream ..lots of people running in one direction. I was told not to go with that group they will assault you. They already had a woman and people were all around her and the attackers and they would see what they were going to do to her. I was horrified at what was going on. Then there was a projection to the sky that would show everyone what they were doing to her. Again horrified. But when the projection started it was something innocuous like a pleasant movie of a circus or parade or something totally unlike the scene I thought was happening below the projection. I woke.

16398L,"I had a dream about my contract renewal (which is coming up this year) and that somehow I was on campus and asked to step into the department administrator's office where someone representing the dean was there. It should have been a happy dream, because they agreed to what I requested (which was a 1/2 time position going forward that my husband has been demanding I do - all of this is real) and they were giving me a huge raise (which they can't possibly do), but I burst into tears when they told me it was because they had saved money because of the death of our building's custodian (who DID die of Covid end of March). That woke me up and I was pretty much awake for the rest of the night, although I know I also dozed a bit"
16567L,"It was more vague than last night - something about cooking integrated with work I needed to do. It felt dire, but I can't tell you why"
18047L,"the only one I remember is a bizarre dream about the eye doctor appointment I actually do have next week, where no one would tell me anything or give me a new prescription (which I really do need) and they left me alone with a bunch of people in a small office room when I thought they were going to run a test but no one did and no one was wearing a mask.  And then somehow I ended up outside in front of someone's house I know watching with a bunch of people - we were all sitting on the ground and I was being attacked by mosquitoes"
20290L,UGH - about a meeting I was having at 7 this a.m. and trying to hash out the framework for what was due to the Dean - it was far too realistic

I was touched that he still wanted to help me, knowing that I could murder him."
11893L,"I was starting a new job with similar coworkers. I was supposed to learn how to draw blood, but screwed something up. Things were stressful, wrong place at the wrong time situations. But then a few of us went on a walk, it was in the most beautiful place with rivers and green mountains, it was awe inspiring and peaceful. I think it was the Columbian jungle, and I met a man who said he takes people on boat trips from Columbia to Italy."

Dream # 2:  With the same grit and sense of necessity, I push an army tanker into the ocean. Dream #3: My forebears are crossing the US prairis in covered wagons. As I pondered all this when I awoke this morning, I thought of the book I was reading yesterday about Celtic prowess in the centuries before Roman conquest. (My roots are Celtic.)   The first dreams, said to me that it is urgent for us to drastically alter our way of life. The third reminded me that we have done this before. We CAN change. We must. We may have to be forced, but we are capable of great change in our way of life. Survival requires it."

23165L,I was talking to the people  I had some erotic dreams
1662L,"I had vivid dreams, probably because I perceived my sleep as light.  The last dream I had was long, colorful and very detailed. It was about me moving and I had many of my friends helping me out. The dream is way too long to describe here, but one thing that was a major element was that one of my best friends was in charge of a huge BBQ. It was a long grill table with colorful vegetables and other good stuff piled on top. I am moving in real life too, which has been worrying me a bit, especially now during corona times. And one thing that I have been thinking about is how to move a large gardening furniture that is very very heavy and that I have potatoes planted in. In the dream, my friend told me to go and get some potatoes for the grill, and I said that they are probably not ready yet. Then she told me that her potatoes that she is growing are finished in 14 days. That made me happy because that could mean that it would be easier to move the plant thing if the potatoes were already ready to eat. So I went to pic some, and they looked very nice. But it turned out that they were green and we could not eat them."

When the other student got up to leave, so did I, but when I looked at my planner, it said my meeting wasn't supposed to end until 13:30 (I had left at 11:30). I was anxious about whether or not I should go back but I decided to go to my office. There, a different psychology professor was having office hours with my partner, telling him this is the fifth time he's failed the English course and there's only one level lower than the one he's in (my partner is not taking any classes). I pretended like I didn't know him so I could listen in then I followed him as he walked out. I put my hand on his back and asked him if he was ok then a different student asked me to go to a third professor's office. This person I did not recognize, but I think he was supposed to be the head of the department. He told me that because I overheard a conversation I wasn't supposed to, I was going to have to stay late into the evening. I asked him what time and he told me 2230 to which I responded that's past my bedtime. He laughed and said ""midnight, then"" and pointed me toward a huge cardboard box of exams I now had to grade."
13242L,I dreamt I was in an IKEA but I didn't have a mask and nobody was social distancing. I was anxious to get my things and leave but I was pulled aside by a police officer because I looked like a wanted suspect. He asked me about my tattoos to try and identify me. I reported some of my actual tattoos but I also had some I don't have in real life. The officer told me I needed to know the details of my tattoos better but said the birthmark on my calf was good enough to determine I was not the suspect.
1258L,I had two dreams:   One was with my coworkers but we were all sitting on picnic benches outside and working from there. It was hard to get work done and some coworkers were way more productive and hard working than others. My closest coworker didn't bring their laptop with them because they didn't have a charger which I told them was silly bc we all had chargers.  The second was my old housemate (who is awful and I hated living with him) somehow moved into our apartment and had taken the spare room without us knowing. I tried to go off on him while he was making breakfast to tell him not to ruin our stuff but he was using his own stuff. I also told him he wasn't allowed to go places like the rock gym or be social and he responded very nonchalantly that I shouldn't worry and he wouldn't be leaving the house. Which honestly made it worse to realize

1501L,I had a dream that my coworker (who I have a crush on) brought me really fancy gifts - I think Gucci products - and told me that he was in love with me. I went on to have an anxious dilemma as to whether to be with him or whether to stay with my boyfriend. It was pretty intense and I definitely felt weird waking up after having a dream like that.
1785L,I was giving a tour of two different small cruise ships to family members. But my kids kept getting locked in various spaces.
1347L,"I remembered right when I woke up but it's harder to recall now. In one of my dreams I was at work but a lot of my old friends from undergrad were there, and I was learning a new technique for some kind of human brain imaging or something. The participants had to be hooked up to an IV, which is what I was supposed to practice but no one had really shown me how to do it yet. I think in a different part of my dream I was racing something, like a car or something."
1437L,"I don't remember at this point but I did when I woke up. It was something work-related. And another dream ultimate frisbee related. I was playing frisbee (which I don't play competitively anymore but did in college and high school). People from my college and from the club scene here were there, and we were trying to play, but it was rainy and I think we were at a playground, and the games were delayed."
1332L,"I was in Istanbul (my university is there). There were 8-9 orphans at the age of 5, and I was trying to give them to the authorities. First, they accepted these children, but then they sent them back as they were 'clones' of some other people. In the mean time, my mom was also in the town, we meet and she goes to a comedy show. I once again try to find a place for the children atleast for the weekend, so I call my friends, go to their house etc. Then I remember that I have a house so they can stay at my place. But my mom is in town and I am not sure if she will stay at my place or we will leave together to my homecity tonight."

One did involved having a whole bunch of objects permanently around me that all had ""COVID-19"" written on them, and I couldn't move them or get rid of them. Another dream was a house party of sorts with a bunch of South Americans that I had just met (in my dream). There were 3 more distinct dreams that I can't recall now, but that were very vivid at the time. One I know I woke up from when I was about to burst into tears in the dream (can't remember what about) - and that was when I was awake for the longest afterwards."
13334L,"I was trying to buy 150 items at the grocery store and I couldn't work out how to do it because the limit was 50 and there was a cost for each order.   I also dreamt that I was at some sort of house/shop owned by an old boss/mentor of mine and I had to leave to catch a plane, but I was running really late.

He looked a lot like Damon Wayans, who I definitely didn't go to school with but in my dream it made total sense. All the mean people were still mean. All the friendly people were still friendly.

While waiting for my mother to find us I tried to calculate the total of everything we wanted to buy. Before my mother found me, I realized some of my friends wereIn another part of my dream I was going to see a doctor through telehealth (I have an apt today in real life). It was a mix of a doctor's office and my graduate school. There was also a part where a patient asked me to find marijuana for him so I did.

After the party, I was with my boyfriend in our own room and we slept there - we woke up at 5:30pm the next day. I was writing to one of my childhood friend that I woke up that late, then felt bad because we haven't talked for years. I went out in the field, it was actually my parents backyard, but amplified, much larger, as if it was the countryside instead of the suburbs. I went to see another one of the little house by a wood. My cousin was there, they were hanging things on the ceiling, installing professional lights to make a clip. I saw part of the clip, a girl running in the forest. The first part was animated (drawing) then it became real footage, I wondered how they made that. I looked back at our own 'house'/room where we slept with binoculars, my boyfriend was sitting on the balcony reading, and there was a cat sitting next to him. It was endearing."

15153L,"I was with a man I had a crush on about 15 years ago walking through a cafeteria line. I took a straw over to a room that looked like a tree house and had two women in it. I showed them that I had peeled the straw apart at the top and told them that if I hadn't peeled it, it would have said one thing about my personality, but since I had, it said another thing. I thought this was hilarious, but they just politely smiled."
16773L,"I dreamed I was at some sort of retreat. We were having ""Sunday dinner"" like on a farm. I was packing little baggies of dollar store trinkets to use as prizes for something. My friend then told me she was pregnant, and she was visibly pregnant but I hadn't wanted to ask. She said it was unintended but that she was happy about it, except she was afraid it might make her worse at salsa dancing."
18108L,"I was living in Connecticut again. I decided to get a motorcycle and went to a motorcycle rally even though it was literally the first time I was driving one. I pulled into a gas station and just sat there because I didn't know how to gas up and wasn't really sure how to accelerate. A woman and her daughter drove up next to me and agreed to help. The mom got on the bike with me and the daughter rode slowly behind me, and they took me back home. I worked and lived in the same compound and I brought them into a secured area at work. They left after a bit and I went into a room where there was a big hand-operated candle-making machine. I remembered that this was actually a historical re-enactment area. ""Ben Franklin"" was making candles. A guy came in and I recognized him as a childhood friend. We spoke warmly to each other and held hands and watched the candles being made."
18827L,I dreamed that I was watching the election and Donald Trump lost AZ but won every swing state east of the Mississippi and won the election

2149L,"I dreamt I was going on a short deployment again for the Air Force and when I got to my assigned barracks, someone had already sort of moved into the beds adjacent to me but then put their extra items on my bed.  I then decided to move all their stuff back onto their bed and move myself in by setting up my bedding.  I also explained to the other women in the barracks that its ridiculous that this other person had decided to bring so much extra stuff that she need to use my space, considering we were only going to be there for about 2 weeks."
1830L,"I was going to work with my refrigerator, I don't remember why but there was a reason. After work I got into a tiny plane with some of my friends to Caribbean islands where there were lots of other tiny planes with young people partying. But suddenly I found my husband with bruises on the chest and we tried to help him. We got back in the plane."
7259L,I traveled to Miami but I had left something unfinished at work so I told my cousin (who was in Miami) to wait for me to come back from work. So I left Miami to go back for few hours to my work (at Peru) but I appeared at my highschool classroom. I had to perform a dance that apparently we were practicing.
1851L,"I kept dreaming that I was late to my dissertation defense. I was talking to a Japanese man and speaking broken Japanese but was surprised at how much I could say. I told him (in English) that I had just received the comments back on my thesis. It was in the form of a large collaged book. All the comments were very positive. I could see the people who wrote them as I read. But I got about halfway through reading when I realized that I was going to be late to my defense. I had not practiced. I wanted to arrive early so that the IT team could test the video connection. I raced over to the room I was defending in and everyone was there except the internal/external examiner who was connecting online. I was surprised that they decided to hold it in-person. My external examiner had her hair cut short and did not smile as she looked at me. I knew the first line I would say in my presentation, but nothing past that. I felt comfortable that I would be able to give the presentation, as I had presented on my research many times before; but I was worried that without practice I wouldn't be very eloquent. Then I realized that I was wearing sunglasses, and that my glasses had a smudge. I wanted to go to my office to get my lens cloth. I asked if I had a couple of minutes, and my supervisor said yes. But as I left I heard the voice of my internal/external connecting over the video and I went back in. Do I have a minute? I asked. But everyone said I should start now."
1931L,"I was with a group traveling through a museum. In an atrium, a man started dancing with me near a small jazz band that was playing. I understood he was my father and he kissed me. I was looking for my dream-boyfriend, who looked like a younger version of my dream-father, and I saw him running across the hall on the other side of a glass door. I waited for him, then we ran together to find a map. All of the rooms in the building were labeled by teachers' names (at this point the building we were in was a school). I figured out a way to where we needed to go, which involved climbing up a vertical cliff edge. I surprised myself by being able to climb it. The texture was a bit soft, like snow, so that I could crush my fingers into the cliff to get up. At the top, someone had to pull me over as I didn't have the strength to get myself over the edge. We found a staircase to the rest of the building and kept going. We found a peculiar staircase with a twisty railing that the building architect had designed for herself, that if you followed to the end led you into a wall. At an intersection in the building, I led the group of us down a hallway that led to a dead-end which was a huge room of storage for Balinese instruments. We turned around and went outside. I was with one girl now. I was stopped by an elderly woman using a walker who walked right next to me and sandwiched me in between two other people. I couldn't move until she passed; and then she yelled at the girl behind me for blocking her path. As we entered a courtyard, I realized how crowded it was. Almost as soon as I had realized this, I realized with dread that no one was practicing social distancing. I pulled the collar of my t-shirt up to my face to cover my nose and tried to avoid everyone's path as I walked. Finally we saw our group up ahead, all wearing matching brown shirts and standing 6 feet apart, and ran over to them."
11753L,"Several parts that I don't know how fit together:    A male friend and I were dressed as toddlers. We were with an actual child, and we entered an auditorium that was full of seated people. The man on the stage announced that all kindergarteners should sit in the very first (back) row. My friend entered the second row and people were surprised (I think the rows were in order of age). I followed him in. Our kindergarten friend¬†went into the first row but then he climbed over into our row. I put him on my lap.¬†    There was a man who had been trying to get my attention for a while but who I always ignored. One day as I was walking¬†through the building where he worked I finally acknowledged him and said ""bye,"" and called him a nickname (I forget what it was). He said what? I repeated it. He came over to me and I put my arm around his hips (he was very tall). He gave me an earring, which he was helping me put in my ear. It wasn't going through because my hole had closed up a little. I took the earring and pushed it through. There was a little blood. He gave me an alcohol swab. I said you can do it again. He came very close to my face and put his arm around my head, caressing it a little, to meet his other hand at my ear. It felt nice. I thought if he kissed me it would feel nice. He finished putting the earring in and it was very long, like a necklace. The back wasn't on properly so I fixed it in place. The earring played a song I didn't like and I had trouble not looking like I hated it. Later I was outside in a garden. Both our cats were there and they both barfed. I was looking at a plant and trying to figure out how old this guy was. He was a billionaire and I thought he must be in his 40s or 50s even though he looked very young. There were other men who wanted me too. One had a startup and made millions of dollars and had always wanted to be with Bjork since he was young (I was Bjork now?). Jake came over and I talked to Jake about whether to date this older person. Then Jake turned into my mom and we were in a kitchen. I said he's 51 years old. And she said No! Creep! and I thought yeah, she's right.¬†    There was a new dad with newborn twins just home from the hospital. He told me that when he got home he farted at them and one baby pooped and the other one peed. I helped him clean up the babies along with the man's mother.¬†"
12297L,"I was at the climbing gym, which had just re-opened, with Sarah. We had just got there but Sarah wanted to leave already. The power went out, so I agreed to leave. It wasn't out for long and when it came back on I thought I'd do just one route before I left. I walked around and saw Lauren but didn't say hi because I didn't want to stay too long and only had a few minutes to climb. I walked up to a route marked V1 but it looked like the start hold was high up. There were holds from other routes on the way up that I tried using, but they were hard to hold onto despite looking like jugs. When I put my feet up I realized I was still wearing socks and not my climbing shoes. I gave up.     Steve called me asking if I had a flashlight. When I asked what he needed it for he said he had to look between his mattress and boxspring because he had bedbugs. I was horrified and sad because that meant that I couldn't come over anymore."
12709L,The only part I can remember is someone giving me a baby bird to take care of. I asked them what the feeding schedule was and they told me what intervals to feed the bird. I spent the dream feeding this bird while doing other things I can't remember.
13304L,"Steve had just been to an event; maybe a Black Lives Matter protest. I had a feeling Nneka was there and he didn't tell me outright it was her but said someone named ""Nica, with a K"" was there and I knew who it was. I was outside at the event/protest and saw S. I didn't talk to him or anyone and avoided him.     The mom Courtney (?) from the instagram account napkinapocaplyse was leaving for vacation. I helped her lock up the house. She biked out the front door with the twins in the back. Outside I saw Stephanie and Jackie who I gave a quick hug to but said I couldn't stay. I was on the top floor of a building and I had to get out. I went down in an elevator and it landed in a Japanese restaurant in the basement. I spoke to the waitress in Japanese, telling her how many people there were, but we had to order in English. There were trays being handed out with onigiri and sushi. I tried to grab a tray of umeboshi sushi but instead I just got plain onigiri.     I was practicing an interview with Anum for an unpaid internship. I said that my previous work at the career center had prepared me by allowing me to develop transferrable skills like time management, organization, and initiative."
13731L,"I was with a friend who was wearing fancy clothes, a heavy white button-down and suspenders. I was very attracted to him and we kissed. He was bald and looked like one of the guards on Orange Is the New Black. Later I was outside at some steps where people were sitting. It was dark. I saw a bat fly up to a girl's head and eat a bug on her hair. She didn't notice. I saw the guy I had kissed with other girls and saw him kiss someone else, then walk away with her. Later I saw him again and ran up to him and kissed him, but he was old and looked like Joe Biden. I got ready to head out to get more of my favorite snack at that moment, ketchup chips. I wondered if I would hate them from eating them too much and associating them with this relationship. I walked to a river and stood over a bridge looking down. I saw two white and soft-looking turtles. I saw more animals too. Two friends came and I said look at the turtles but we couldn't find them. Then I was with Shelby and Hayley in a small room painted white. The room had curved walls and a high ceiling. We took our clothes off to clean the walls. Shelby climbed up a ladder and started hosing the walls down. I saw two condoms stuck to the walls and peeled them off into a trash bag. It was so disgusting.     I was with Cindy sitting across from her at a table. I told her that my bedroom was very small but cozy and cute. I was describing it to her. I said there's a closet on one side, then the bed, then a bookshelf... but I couldn't remember what else was in my room.     Someone (maybe Cindy) told me that a forest in town had been burned down to make room for some kind of development. I said but what about the hammerheads?? There was a nest of pileated woodpeckers in the forest with baby birds that hadn't fledged yet. I knew that they were probably dead. I was so upset. Why couldn't they wait to tear it down until after nesting season?    I was out shopping with my mom. I waited for her outside a store and decided to go into a different store. As I walked in I realized there would be people and I might have to touch things, but the door was propped open and I walked to avoid passing others. I thought I should leave right away but saw jigsaw puzzles and other games and looked at those first. Then I left and went into a kind of atrium, the kind in shopping malls, and saw my mom running ahead of me. I wanted to run and catch up with her but it was hard to run so I just yelled ""mom!"" and she stopped."
14205L,"Can't remember much; I remember one part where I had white ants crawling on me and they were very itchy. In another dream, I saw two people in blackface."
14752L,"I was in a hallway with many people. Everyone was bent forward and linked together, so that they created a kind of bridge. Someone ran across. A little boy was there and wanted to run across. I was at the end of the hallway with him. He jumped up and caught the end of a ceiling light, which I was afraid was going to be damaged, but he let go and landed on the human bridge. He ran across, and then I noticed that a pipe had been damaged from him and was leaking. I grabbed a bucket which turned out to be a trash can and put it under the leak to catch the water. I ran to the stairwell to get to the 3rd floor to find the psychology department staff to get help with the leak. I got off on the 4th floor, realized it was the wrong one, and finally found the 3rd floor. At the middle of the hallway I ran into Myra. She asked if I could help with something and I said I'm busy and it's urgent. She didn't seem to care and kept telling me about a hotel she had booked for a conference, and that the bank account she was using was U.S. She stopped to look for something in her papers and I said find me later, I need to go sort this out. She said it must be urgent and I said yes. I ran down to the other end of the hallway and found the reception desk. The girl who works at health services was there. I told them about the leak. Then Tammy came over and her hair was up. Then the leak and the trash can were on the reception desk, right between us."
15453L,"Steve and I were looking at shelves of VHS tapes and DVDs that belonged to his landlord. I was trying to pick out a VHS tape to watch because we had a VHS player. Then I realized I didn't have to limit to VHS, I could also choose a DVD. Steve wanted to play Season 5 of a children's wrestling show which we had never watched. I said what about starting with Season 4? I saw the Season 4 DVDs. Then I saw Season 3, 2, and 1. Yeah, said Steve, 1! Then next to the first season there was a Curious George book. I pulled it out and started reading. The words in the book were so worn it was hard to read. But some of the words had been written over in pen. On the second page it said in the narration [my name] (redacted for participant de-identification!). I said wait a minute. This book must be mine! My mom must have sent away for a custom book when I was a baby. But why didn't I have the book anymore? How did it get here and what was the Curious George book I had in my room?"

Sho was at first a little quiet and at one point I noticed he was so skinny, he had lost so much weight and then I went to get Hanna and we came back and Hanna and Darlene were dressed almost alike, each in red trousers and a white sweater and Sho was wearing a knit hat with a brim with a very big stitch that Darlene had apparently given him and it was a nice house,  it was different from the Spencer lofts in Chelsea MA where we used to live and were neighbors, and there was one room that had a glass window in it and you could see it from the hallway even though the door was shut but it was very elegant and fancy with lots of fluffy fake fur, it was a special room and Darlene was cooking and I kept wishing we hadn't gone there because Darlene was such a mixture of shallowness, friendliness, poor taste and good taste, also she is super-extroverted, then a friend of Darlene's came, she was this English woman whom I had spoken to on the phone many times but never met before and every time I spoke to her she would mention Al Capone for some reason and I was wearing blue jeans and she was looking at them and touching the bluejeans and she said ""Al Capone"" like the bluejeans reminded her of Al Capone and she was very old and shriveled up and she was talking with an English accent. I had no idea that she looked so old and so near death, I never got that impression from her telephone voice. I was hoping that Sho would be in a good, personable mood and I knew Hanna would be. Ron, Darlene's husband wasn't there yet and also we had arrived there super-early like at 1 PM because Darlene had said come over in the afternoon without specifying time, and as soon as we got there and rang the bell and she opened the door she had this weird look on her face when she saw us, I knew we had arrived way too early and we could have arrived at 4PM instead of 1 PM.  I don't know why people like that whom I don't respect are always making me feel stupid, like I'm the one at fault.  Sho was supposed to be coming later but he got there early also and he seemed very uncomfortable. I knew he wished he hadn't come and I wished I hadn't asked him to, because it was not a good situation for him and at one point Hanna and I left to go get something and when we came back it looked like Sho had taken a nap or something like that but then he perked up and was wearing that hat and smiling and talking and I was hoping he would be lively when we all sat down to dinner."
13791L,"I was looking at an Internet page, a website, and I saw a lot of pictures and explanations and then the page turned into a net and some of the holes in the net were open and some had pictures but all the words had disappeared so nobody knew what the pictures were about anymore"
14264L,"I was walking outside, it was dark, with some man who was doing some important work and I was commenting on the work and I said, referring to some type of animal we saw while walking, ""he's part of the meshpukha (family group)"" and I said that Yiddish word knowing that I would impress him and I would see if I could make him laugh and he did and I thought ""oh it worked"". For some reason I had to make sure he didn't get angry, the way women know they often need to do with men to keep them from getting angry and violent. He had a kind of balding head, I don't know who he was, I knew if he got angry he'd be violent and when I woke up thinking about this dream I was thinking of the word ""walking"" and I couldn't stop thinking of the songs that had ""walking"" in the title, but thinking about these songs made me very annoyed."
15197L,"It had snowed quite a lot in Fresno (a desert town with little precipitation not to speak of snow) and when I looked out the window I saw the house on Pine Street where I grew up and it there was so much snow all around piled up and people kept saying to me ""it's snow, it snowed and snowed in Fresno!"" and it's summer it's June and I said ""oh"" and I looked out the window and I thought we were in Boston and so I didn't I didn't think anything of it but then people wanted me to fix it and even when I realized it was Fresno I wasn't surprised but I didn't think there was anything to fix."
15459L,"An announcement was being made. I could see it written across the ""screen"" of my dream. It was short and simple but deep & profound and I knew it revealed a secret of life and would be important guidance in life. I was half awake and remembering it, thinking I would never forget what it said but in the morning I forgot it completely."
16029L,"I was watching a a big group of people of all ages get in a group for a photo in a park under some trees. There were lots of people, smiling kids, all close together with no masks which I wondered about, and many of the people had dark skin. Though I am not dark-skinned I understood all of the people to be members of my family, even if I didn't know each of them. Some of the boys had curly dark hair. I also knew that I would be a part of the photo, or maybe I was taking the picture."
16447L,"I was in my house and someone else was there. We were looking at the floor and suddenly a zillion tiny brown cockroaches were covering the floor, running madly. I knew even if I started smashing them, I would only kill a fraction and they would be in my house forever.  2nd dream:  I was in a national park, like Yosemite. I was pushing a shopping cart and something else smaller on wheels. There was a small parking lot next to a campground and a few people looking at me. I let go of the shopping cart for a second and it started to roll down a granite rocky hill. No one watching came to my aid. I was a little frantic and embarrassed. I ran to catch the shopping cart before it go too far. I got it and started rolling it and the other wheeled thing up the hill."
16766L,"I was on an open sort of train (no roof), yellow on outside and bright green seats. I was looking for the express to ""Sac"" (Sacramento). I saw the train and the lighted words ""Sac"" on the front but I just missed it. I was in a place I have seen in my dreams before, kind of like a confusing place like Park St Station in Boston and that intersection in Paris where you cross over from  the Ile St Louis to the Marais. I was hot, sweaty and trying to get on a train without time to buy a ticket. I had to get to ""Sac."""
17376L,"I had a dream a week or more ago about zillions of small cockroaches racing across the floor of my house. Yesterday while spraying for cockroaches in the front of my house, zillions of baby cockroaches came running out from under the siding, just as in my dream."
18174L,"I was in some place like a big open market and I was walking around there, it was someplace like a cross between Florence or Venice and Cambridge and I had to go there dressed carefully because Larry David  (the actor/comedian) was working there and I wanted him to like me.  I was holding a sheet of paper with something I had written on it and it was the whole scenario that was about to happen or some other experience that had already happened and I was thinking that I knew once I surrendered to a tempting but dangerous feeling it would be too late to turn back and I had to steel myself if I didn't want it to happen but it did. For some reason I expected it to happen in that place. I had dressed carefully and I was wearing a brownish-orange jumper and I knew I looked nice and Larry David even said ""oh I like your jumper."" He was behaving thoughtfully, out of character for him,  flirting with me, and then he started to get friendly and then we sat down together and he leaned in to kiss me and he opened his mouth wide as he leaned in which I thought was odd and then when we kissed his mouth was really cold and I thought oh this is unpleasant, maybe it will get better and then I started to wonder did I regret this? and then in another scene we were all walking down a long, wide ancient hallway with a big crowd of people and in front of me was a cute dark-skinned teenaged girl in a black swimming suit and she was very small and thin but she had a slightly flabby body that everyone could see because she was exposed in the swimming suit but she had the obliviousness of youth and I was worried that I was going to have to be naked in front of someone (namely Larry David) and it wasn't going to be good. Walking down the hall, I could see it was very large and ancient building but it was filled with junk & storage and it was crowded. It was sort of a cross between the Vatican and the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston. The crowd was going somewhere for some event that was happening; everyone was walking there through the hallway. I was one of the crowd and I don't know what happened to Larry David but even though the hall was crowded and slow- moving and I didn't really know what was at the end of it, I was relieved I wouldn't have to go home with him and start worrying about what he wanted to do, eat for dinner, wash his clothes or any of that. I knew he would be a big pain to have to be around constantly."
18792L,"Dream #1 I was outside in a dirty area, lots of dirt, and there was a fence made by Biden supporters. It was foldable and people were trying to get it open. Somehow when opened it showed a ""for"" or ""against"" side and when you thought you had the ""against"" side, by the time you opened it up, it was ""for"" Biden, and when you thought it was ""for"" it was really ""against"" so I looked at it closely and it was ""for"" and ""against"" on the same side.  Dream #2 I was looking at a TV screen and important information about the election was being given by a news announcer , a middle-aged man with mostly white hair and a bow tie, but he was speaking an unusual foreign language that no one could understand and no matter how closely you listened it didn't make any sense."
20284L,"I was with Sho (my son) and he got a fax and it was a letter from the job interview he just had & he looked up and looked at the letter then looked upset and then crumpled up the letter and shoved it in his pocket and I said oh no what happened is it is it a rejection letter? and then he handed me the letter or rather other parts of the letter that he hadn't put in his pocket and it was page after page after page of this old-fashioned kind of computer print-out paper but it was a long letter explaining everything about the hospital where Sho had interviewed and it was talking all about different processes and all kinds of details and pictures and diagrams and explanations and I was looking at it and I thought how is this a rejection letter? and then I looked over at Sho and  he said to me ""I got it!"" and I said what do you mean I thought you just crumpled up a rejection letter and he said well I don't know if I got the job or not, I can't tell and I said gosh I don't know it's so confusing because it seems like you got it, if they are telling you all these details but what does the other letter say, the one you crumpled up and put it in your pocket? and he started to take it out of his pocket and smooth it out so I could read it and then suddenly we were all going to lunch, Nancy (my sister), me, and someone else, and Brian Bobbitt from the local political activism group here was there and he was going to drive everyone to this new restaurant and we were in a little area of a town that had a lot of small shops and one of the shops was Brian's and it was like a cookie shop or something, and the roads though were all dirt roads and up I was anxious about Sho's job letter but we had to get going because Brian was ready to leave and he was driving us and there was a new restaurant I was thinking about and I said or I wanted to say I hope we're going to this restaurant but I didn't know if Brian had known about it or if it was OK for me to mention it but I kept thinking about this restaurant, the kind of food they serve, and I was getting really hungry and thinking about food but on the way out I grabbed a cookie from Brian's shelf and I went back and grabbed a paper towel to wrap the cookie in and I was worried I was holding up the drive to the restaurant plus I was wondering if Sho had gotten a job offer and just didn't understand the letter correctly or something, then I think I woke up at that point."

8650L,"The fact that it takes me over an hour to write up dreams often results in me not filling out the survey, so I think I'm going to do bullet points for each dream or scene from now on.  -This was about a couple I know in real life. She was leaving the house and packing up the cat's food in order to take the cat with her.  -I was in the garage and 3 cats chose me to be their owner. I had cat toys & a cat tree in the garage which I gathered and then set up in the house. All the while the cats were nearby.  -I was at my (real life) high school and didn't know which locker was mine, or the combination. The administrator I had to go to for help was my mother's (real life) friend. The interaction reminded me of why I don't like her.   -One of my high school classmates was an adult working at the high school. He had the courage to fire an older man with a huge ego who had many connections and a big mouth who was all talk and, unbeknownst to many people, failing at his job.  -There was a big black-tie fundraising event with many people. One older woman loved all the attention and ass-kissing she got from the people courting her for money; that was the reason she donated. She experienced a health issue and teh paramedics came to take her to the hospital, but she didn't want to go and one of the ass-kissers helped her get out of it.  -I was a young adults in the company of other young women. It was late in the evening and one young woman was putting a lot of effort into trying to get the group to go out."

The driver is erratic and I'm worried he'll crash. Eventually, we do crash into the ocean. I see a whale in the sky and know it's a dream. Lucid, I grab the whale from the sky and bring it into the water. The whale is grateful and allows me to survive. The others don't make it. I wonder what to do next with my lucidity and it fades.    2.) I'm a merchant in an old market. I seem to be hoarding bread. I hear a voice-over talking about how I was a cook in a past life.

One room was very enclosed with many, many shelves, tiny shelves and on them all type of figurines (all very small themselves).  Light was pouring in from above as that was the opening for that room.  I can't remember what we were doing there, but it was a very cool place."
12610L,"I dreamt that I was at some club for vacations and was hanging out with all of these older people (the men were mostly gay).  My brother was there too, but as his younger self.  I was about to go out to lunch with these older people, and wanted to find my brother to let him know.  He was on some type of lazy river that happened to be directly in the middle of the complex, so I hoped over there to try and find him.  I did luckily, just before he was going to go down the slide and told him.  Then I was off to my lunch."
13073L,"I dreamt that I was a black man (I am a white woman), and I was challenged by these other black guys, students at the same school I went to, to make some sort of quiche.  There were limitations in terms of how much I could spend and what I could do.  I had help from another friend who kept feeding me information on how to save my back.

14005L,"I dreamt that I was with some old friends from high school.  We were all going to go to a movie.  We planned to meet at the theatre and go to see the film...I was running late and missed it.  I called my friend Matt, who was supposed to go and he said he missed it too, so we met up.  Then Doug, who was coordinating it, said he missed it too.  So we all ended up going to his mom's house and she had this ridiculous setup.  The had a pasta machine that we tried and it could cook pasta perfectly....it looked like a dishwasher and you would just pull the pasta out.  It was enourmous and you could easily cook for hundreds of people using it..."
14447L,"I dreamt that I was in Israel.  I was there for a brief time. And while I was there, there was a huge war.  I was not scared though...and I think I had just moved there, so was open to all things being new.      I went to Temple (something I never do) and was trying to meet new people.  All of a sudden a new meeting was arranged and people who wanted to go, could go.  They were going to discuss the way we would fight the war.  I was curious and wanted to go.    I had tons of dry cleaning with me for some reason, and just schleped them along with me.  Upon arriving at this new undisclosed place which was open to the sky and surrounded by walls that were taller by our heads by about 3 feet.  Cars would just appear from the outside and take the stairs up and in.  For those who did not get their early and want to bring their car inside, they tried to get in by going along the wall, which was only as wide as a brick, needless to say, the first car I saw, nose dived into an already parked car, but another one made it in safely and just parked on top of an already existing car.    The man started his speech and I was sitting front row and just in front of him.  He started saying how he didn't understand why the US was not immediately coming to their aid.  I, having just moved their from the US, decided to stand up and speak on behalf of the US and explain how Trump was a horrible leader and we could expect nothing from him.    The meeting ended quite quickly and I was seated next to two cool girls that I wanted to be friends with.  I told them that I was staying in this suburb outside of the city and said it was pretty cool...I really wanted to be friends with one of them, who cooly said ""I want to come and see this cool neighborhood.  You should invite me."" and then vanished downstairs to get her things.  As I said, ""Can I get your number?"" She was already gone.    The woman of the family that I was staying with appeared and came to help me get back to our neighborhood.  She helped me carry my dry cleaning as well, which at that point had fallen off some of the hangers.      We were on our way back to our house, but she wanted to stop off to have a drink.  Low and behold, the two girls that I wanted to hang out with, were there and we became friends instantly.  I was so happy to have found new friends in Israel."

And this family had taken me in and they were all pretending that they weren't trying to help me, but I started to figure out that their mother had told the girls to gather up clothes that they didn't want and that they would give the clothes to me later.  I could see that this one girl had two beautiful sweaters that were never worn, but she was super hesitant.  I didn't want the sweaters if she didn't want to give them to me, so I made up a story whose message was : Doubt means don't.  So she didn't end up giving me the sweaters and put them back in her closet.  However, I did see that there was a huge bag overflowing with clothes in the entryway, so I figured I could get at least one good item..."
15292L,"I had multiple dreams.  One of the dreams I can remember was me as an assistant trying out a new job.  It was my first day on the job.  It was at my old office in NYC, but all of the women assistants had changed except for 1.  They seemed to be a friendly group.  I was to be assigned to a OBGYN.  After getting a tour of the space, I realized that I had to get to work.  I sat down in our space (the doctor and I shared this fairly large cubicle type area) and when I sat down after moving the mouse, I realized it was her computer.  The mouse was set on some sort of auto program and started opening things up that were not for me to see.  I instantly moved away from the computer and sat at my new computer..."
15689L,"I dreamt that I was going to get a 60 minute massage.  I had to get changed before and I didn't want to waste any time as I would loose precious minutes of my massage.  The changing room ended up being half way across the hotel.  I ended up jumping into a pool of water to make the trip shorter.  Then got lost and had to ask where the changing room was.  Once I was in the changing room people started coming up to me and talking to me, distracting me from getting changed.  I finally get changed, head back to the massage area and once there my masseuse tells me to take off my necklace (of course, forgot that too!) and then we get started...but of course I lost time and I wasn't as efficient as I would have hoped."

I went to the library to look at encyclopedias but there were none.  There were also no computers.  Then he said he wanted it to be for Wed.  This must have been Friday.  He wanted it to be an entire day program with speakers (people).  told him there was no way that I could do that with so little time, figuring I would be fired (but I was working in a school at age 77?).  He just walked off and didn't respond.  Another dream was trying to put something together with something like Lego's - grey and yellow -   I needed more but couldn't go out and get any more due to the stay at home thing."

3251L,"My neighbors and my family were packing for a camping trip to Alaska sometime in the winter, so we had to pack a lot of blankets and warm clothes.

13977L,I was going to a concert at night. I parked in a lot near the venue. There was a trash bin near car. Peopke parked near my car. Young people. Mostly careless but one group had masks and goggles. I decided not to go because the crowd. I had lots of beer in the car for some reason.
14204L,I was at some facility away from here. I remember going to the lunch room. Then I remember parking car in a space adjacent to a lake. There was a sports event taking place on Lake like softball. Strange. A person I knew was supposed to play and I was in position to watch.

14706L,I dreamt about being with my partner at the beach with a LOT of people that seemed to be our friends from high school. There was something about a big group photo that was taking forever and I remember something about me getting dizzy/lightheaded while we were trying to pose for the photo.

12003L,Sex with husband Dream
12369L,I was holding a glass vase and I dropped it off a shelf. Part of it sliced open my neck and my mom was there and said I was bleeding. I didn't think it was a big deal because it didn't hurt but she said no it's like deep dark blood that's gushing. So I thought yep that's not good. I went to emerg and had to have emergency surgery. I was fine. Only 2 stitches somehow. I remember recounting the story to my husband. Also remember grocery shopping and I bought a fresh pizza that they were randomly selling on a food cart in the middle of the store.
12755L,I had two separate dreams that I lived in two different houses. I remember the floor plans and everything but obviously too hard to describe in here.
16605L,sexual in nature.
23656L,I had a weird dream that I was in bed sleeping and my husband came in the room and then grabbed the sides of my face/neck so I couldn't move and turned into a vampire and was like growling at me. It was terrifying. I don't usually have nightmares.
13487L,"In last snippet, I had done a blood test, somehow remotely, and a woman, medical- nurse, NP?- telling me that my potassium levels were high. We were discussing that potassium was being used in place of salt so food products could claim to be low sodium...  Self analysis: I have an annual Medicare physical exam in July that I won't be keeping until we are sure there is zero threat of exposure to C19. My husband and I had been joking about building our own EKG equipment. So our cancelled appointment were on our minds. And m'y husband's feet have been swollen and his bp higher than normal inspire of his bp meds, no added salt in our diets, low sodium etc. Trying to figure out why and what to change or do differently."
13876L,"Young woman, perhaps a relative, had an infant she couldn't or didn't want to take care of and I offered to take the child, considering splitting the childcare among several other people. Was thinking through a plan of how to do this.    Self analysis: our daughter is currently doing this and 2 70+ year old friends have done this. Admire them all and would do the same. Perhaps question my energy level however. Therefore, the time sharing,"
14320L,"My husband and I had some kind of therapeutic appointment. I was going in as he was coming out. He told me it was not what we expected and to watch out for something...not sure what. I went in for my turn and there was a small, long, narrow room, brightly lit with minimal decor or furniture . One whole side was taken up by a large bed. The doorway to the room was in the middle. A stocky, unattractive Asian, shirtless man was sitting bolt upright  on the bed, back to the door with a fluffy white cotton comforter pulled up to his waist, covering his legs and lower body. The mattress took up that whole side of the room, wall to wall. No head or footboard. I got on to my side of the bed, to the left side of the man, with my clothes on, confused by the situation. I pulled up the comforter and sat up straight like the man. I put my right hand down for support and felt something soft and squishy. When I looked under the top of the comforter, it looked like rabbit droppings. Raising the blanket more, I saw 3 full grown, live, bright yellow ducks lined up in vertical row. The droppings were theirs. I didn't know what to make of the situation or what was going to happen or what the treatment was going to be.    Self analysis: My first thought was that it was about getting ""my ducks in a row"" which makes me laugh, if that was the message. We have been treating quarantine like an extended vacation- lots of reading and movies and leisurely discussions because we don't have to go to appointments and have no demanding social commitments. However, there is much work to be done in this house, both paperwork and physical work. Which we are neglecting.  Our son has been heavily involved In meditation and just completed a 7 day retreat, with much upright sitting. Which he said was very hard on his back. We also have a Chinese acupuncturist that we have not been able to see since quarantine began. Perhaps the other part of the message to myself was to ""watch out for shit"" because I think our son has gone overboard on the things he gets involved in, as if this new yoga/meditation guru had all of the answers. Not that I would tell him that. And figuring out how to safely resume sessions in the future."
15499L,"Riding on a bus with my husband. Sitting together near the front on the driver's side. Firm seats, not a plush, fancy bus. Don't know where we are going.   I get up and try to go to the back. I think we had bags in an overhead rack towards the back. There are at least 2 people that have fallen over, asleep, each taking up 2 seats. One woman's head and upper torso are out in the aisle. Otherwise, all other seats are occupied except for the ones across the woman in the aisle.  I retrieve a bag with 2 donuts and sit down in the empty seats across deodorant, the oddly positioned woman. I motion for Jim to join me to eat his donut. Mine is chocolate covered and his is very large, pretzel Hale's and has a sugar coating, I think they are very good and surprisingly not greasy.  After finishing my donut, I try to rouse the woman and get her to reposition herself on the 2 seats she has, without her upper half being out in the aisle.  Self analysis: in my dream world, being in a car or bus always represents my life. In this case, my husband and I are on some unknown journey together, not in charge of the destination or journey. Others are around but no one is helping the strange woman who may be ill or drunk or drugged. No one else has helped her, so I do what I can without getting overly involved. Just try to make her a bit safer. Similar to how we are dealing with family and friends and neighbors who are out and about these days, while we stay in quarantine.  As for the donuts, they are favorite treats when we travel. Our usual breakfast with coffee from Dunkin. Haven't had one in 10 months! My husband and I are having a ""sweet time"" together during our lengthy quarantine. Don't know where this journey is headed or when we will ""arrive"" but we are not in charge and are just along for the ride."
16059L,"My first nightmarish dream in a year! I believe it is a Covid19 fear dream.  I was unloading presents and packages out of a station wagon and carrying them into a house. May have been Christmas. Felt like I knew the house but not a place I am familiar with in real life. My kids are there somewhere. Young. Maybe grade school age. There is a phone call for me, on a regular house phone. When I answer it is one oof our best friends, Seth (married to Barb), who tells me they are in San Diego and Jim (my husband) wants to talk to me. Jim gets on the phone is is struggling to talk. I'm asking him why he's in San Diego (A place we went frequently when Jim was working on a Navy problem for his company.) He was supposed to be meeting me and the kids(wherever we are.) He is saying he can't and I am asking for reasons. He's not answering and I am throwing out guesses. Is he leaving us, is he in some kind of trouble (like having to go into Witness Protection), is he going to Mexico, is there another woman, etc.etc. He is crying softly but not answering. I'm distraught. At which point I wake up in a panic.  Self analysis: I don't know that Barb is with Jim and Seth. I had made an assumption when Seth said ""we.""  In reality, Seth is dead. Has been dead for about 5 years. From cancer treatments gone wrong. Jim, too, has had 2 bouts of cancer and has taken meds that almost killed him. We are still in self-quarantine because I fear more for Jim's safety than my own. He picks up viruses very easily and was sick for 2 months with something like Covid19 last fall. Perhaps it was. I think in this dream, Jim was with Seth because he had died. I think it was all tied in with my Covid19 fears and worries about keeping him safe. I've cancelled medical appointments because I don't want to risk bringing anything home to him. Some friends think we're being too cautious, but  we're not giving in to peer pressure. Yet...At ages 73 and 75 our mortality weighs heavily on me at times. The realization that our years are numbered and which one of us will die first. This dream will stay with me for a long time now. Quite unexpected when I feel content with our dailY lives and the gift of this time together, with just each other, no distractions."
16728L,"Had many dreams. The most elaborate involved  a long time(50 yrs) friend that I've had political differences with. We were visiting them, I overheard them misinterpret something my husband said/thought.  I corrected them. I went to her workplace with her (she's a nurse) met coworkers, they were eating lunch together but I was told not so eat with them (I've had issues with understanding her expectations and behaviors) and ended up having a long discussion with her about a patient of mine that had been wrongfully accused of rape and had been physically and psychologically harmed during his time in jail. She was surprised I had ever done any serious work. She also ""gifted"" us with a bowling ball sized globe filled with plastic flowers preserved in resin. It was supposed to look like real flowers in a ball of water. I found it odd and nothing I wanted but accepted graciously, but thought it was a regift and knowing I'd only bring it out if they ever visited us.    I've been struggling with what to do about this relationship. It's always been difficult and now it's been months since we've had any contact. There was nothing comfortable about this dream which is why, I think I see it so vividly, right down to what they were eating and drinking and what the surrounding looked like. I'd chalk this up to a situation/dilemma  brought on by Covid19."
16483L,"I was driving, had at least one person with me, maybe more. I was trying to get to someplace on the other side of a widely divided highway. I knew that if I entered a special U turn lane, I didn't have to go all the way down to a light to do the backtracking. I managed to get in the right hand lane and enter the U turn lane.  Since, in my dreams, cars represent my life, I am definitely sending myself messages about where I am going or trying to get done. Have had many car dreams lately."
18226L,"Many. Only recall last. A nast 20-30 something that looked like a young John Mellencamp, was driving an older model large car. Car was full of guys. They were going thru the fast food drive ups and threatening the kids working the window. This was a small town. I was talking to the teen workers about reporting them to the police. The kids were scared. And Black. Although he hadn't threatened me, I was considering saying that he had and weighing whether I could/should/would commit perjury for a greater good, i.e. the protection of the community vs these thugs. I woke up before I resolved my dilemma."
18795L,"Many. But lost them. Last was seeing people , myself included, shot full of holes. No Pain. Just people milling around dead. With holes like in a cartoon. No noise or talking."
20363L,"Many dreams. But can only recall parts of one:  Driving in a car on a small 2 lane road. Don't recall if I was the driver or a passenger. Passing through a barren field. Could be light colored sand or snow, both sides of the road. A few tree stirmps. Either it was bulldozed or something natural had happened to clear the area. At the edge of the field there was an extremely poor, dilapidated neighborhood in view. On my left I could see weathered jagged boards hanging on what I first thought was a house. As I got closer, it was actually the remnants of a tree house. The houses on both sides were shacks, in terrible shape. This looked like things I've  in the Deep South. That neighborhood gave way to somewhat better, modest houses, but my guess was, low income. Then, the housing became more middle class. I saw or imagined upper class, well to do homes in the distance. My thought was that there were always these economic layers. The very wealthy were never that far away from the poor and couldn't live their lives without them. I've had this perspective for years in my waking life, but surprised that I was reminding myself of this in a dream setting. Perhaps because I've had heavy discussions with my 20 somethings who are to the ""very far left"" of Bernie and desiring social justice and change...."
22312L,"Extremely detailed and elaborate dreams. When I woke up at noon, knowing that a new round was starting today, I stayed in bed to review and try to retain my dreams. At some point I realize that I am sleeping and that I am in the middle of a new dream and have lost what I was originally trying to recall. I decide to continue in these new dreams. I have maybe only had the realization that I was in in a dream and not wake a few times before in my life. We have also traveled a lot. Been in many international airports and foreign hotels. Know what it's like to scramble for  a flight  On Saturday night we zoom chatted with Canadian friends and joked about the utter pre Covid, pre 9/11 craziness we had experienced  of the international terminal in Toronto. Also we watched many movies in the past week with foreign hotel rooms and also was sorting thru travel photos. Last in Europe in 2017 for 4 weeks.  1. My husband and I are staying at a hotel. I get to the room alone. It's an older building and because of the bathroom, especially the tub set up, I am thinking it's European. The room is more like a suite because there are 2 rooms. The entry room has an unenclosed large square tub.  The doorway across from the tub leads into a very large, bright room with a king sized bed and another, even larger tub. There are several tall, clear glass decanter style bottle filled with, what I wrongly assume is bubble bath. I decide to take a bath and empty one decanter into the tub and get in. Because of the texture of the water, I realize the bottle had been filled with vichyssoise. I have a ladle and am trying to drain the water out of the tub while scooping what I can of the soup back into the bottle. I know I am going to have to shower off after I clean up the mess I'm the tub but would like to wash off first.  Another woman, someone I am acquainted with, comes in and, I, embarrassed, try to explain the situation. I am suggesting that she should use the other tub because I am guessing it may have one of those European hand held shower heads. That one is meant to sit down in the tub to shower. I also note a smaller, clear glass bottle with a white substance in it on the smaller tubs edge and am pretty sure that is the real soap or bubble bath. My husband eventually shows up. There is talk about the person (and maybe her spouse) sharing the room with us. There seems to be a problem. There is talk about getting a rollaway and there is a couch. Looking closer at the entry way room, i am thinking there must be a fridge because why put an unrefrigerated bottle of soup in the room. I see a kithenette area in a space by the hallway door. I hadn't noticed it because the door blocked it when I entered and there wasn't a light on. The rooms details are quite elaborate, even down to the wallpaper design.  2. We go into a female acquaintance's room.   Someplace she is going to be living in for awhile. Almost an efficiency but large. I am imagining how the place could be configured to meet her needs. Along the top of one wall, there is a panel of bright, but deeply colored glass vertical rectangles. Reds, deep yellow, orange, blue, green. Covering a stretch of about 9 feet. Below that is an alcove space with what appears to be a rod with lots of strange hooks on it. Perhaps for those wooden hangars, like in some hotels. I assume it's meant to be an open closet. It's strange but I act positive about it, saying that it's good sized and she won't have to struggle with where to put her clothes. Again, the rooms look European to me.  3. I am at a large, European (I think) airport. I am talking to some people. We all are trying to get on flights, not necessarily to the same places. The airport has 2 large buildings and I am saying that one has to watch out for the time of the flight because it can be impossible to get to a flight leaving from the other terminal. The people I am talking to don't seem to be familiar with the airport or how it all works. I tell them that it's happened to me and the people booking the flights for passengers seem oblivious to that detail. I am attempting to book a flight but I know I can't make it to the gate at the time that's being offered to me. The airport is crowded and I think it's going to take a lot of effort to get a flight, if I can even get one. Again, I am thinking this is European or even Toronto. Again, a lot of details about clothing, the ticket desk, building fixtures, etc."

We couldn't find flights back to the US for a few days and my friends were not moving fast in packing and i had to do most of it for them.

To pass the time, I was walking around my very desolate building to send letters. I had a lot of stamps I could use, and some of the stamps had famous actors imitating poets. I left the building in the rain but came back in and saw a friend from college. He's very talkative so I excused myself and went back to my room but then I had to leave the building again.

When we were leaving I couldn't find my coat but I was deciding whether to take someone else's coat because I couldn't remember if I actually had the right memory of the coat I had brought.

3349L,"a lot of dreams. First one with my dead father, he was alive and studied, he had a presentation at our home and his teacher was there. In the dream i remember he started drinking again because of the stress. I was scared of him like i used to.   Another dream. I was part of a adventure group who lived in an old wooden library. We were attacked by an enemy - middle aged guy, typical villain type - and prepared the library for the intrusion.  He still found a way into it through a hole in the cellar where a creature lived that didn't like light - it was a friend of ours.  Villain also found a collar there with old coins which he thought must have been ours.  Later it was revealed that they were the creature's who just forgot that it was a human hundreds of years ago. Oh and the library collapsed but no-one was hurt.  We sat outside and thinking of what to do,  the creature meditated and i sat next to him and when i touched him he showed me a dream...  Next dream I was running in my old hood, because i was sad and angry. During my run i met people and started to remember it's pandemic time and i could infect people by running and not wearing a mask. So i stopped behind a plant and cried. A little later a worker came with an excavator and he took me on his vehicle trying to give me a lesson for life but actually it was more like torture- he had a knife and tried to cut me while driving on the street,  i cried and shout for help but no one reacted to me.  Later i got away don't remember how,  but was on my way back home and had to climb over a hughe red car, that parked half on the way half on the street. The driver sat inside - a younger man,  typical macho man - and whined there was no free space for his car here.  I told him to slowly drive around the block until the person came he was waiting for.  He did so,  i went around the next corner just to see free space. But he was too far gone to tell him.   Last dream, my boyfriend and me had a new house and there were lots of family members with us for some celebration.  Our daughter had a sister and they played together.  I wandered through the house and was happy to see all the bigger rooms and furniture."

My hometown was dreaming, her house was on the field - I ran past, further down the field forward, into the depths. I lured her. We fought. And for some reason they kissed too. I defeated her and she left.    I also dreamed about my school. That in the dining room it was possible only with gloves on. I also dreamed that we were in the forest, there were some threads and toys appearing and that this was all some kind of huge monster who lured us to eat    Then I dreamed of a certain unknown school that we investigated. We got to the director's office. The director turned out to be a very nasty aunt. and she has several rooms, they have all kinds of collections. I took out a magic wand and turned its tree with cassettes into a tree plant. She saw and was very upset and began to drag a replacement there .. but I could not turn it back. By the way, the wand works very strange. I need to strain - and it works, but unpredictable even for me. And I'm sure that this is not my first dream about this magic wand.     Another piece of sleep about the subway, some strange metro train, it was unclear whether they will let us in or not. Some kind of nonsense.  Another piece of sleep - I tried to dance a waltz with a friend, but for some reason it didn't work out. Also I kept remembering some past and crying about it due to the fact that several people from the participants of this past are already dead and it will never happen again ...  At the end of my dream, I remember my boyfriend, who was leading me through the city somewhere, saying that we would come home, wash the dishes together and then decide what we will do next."

A woman took me upstairs to show me the apartments which were more like townhomes. The small one was $50,000 and the large one was $110,000. Both of them had a very narrow hallway to enter and the walls were painted orange and green in Keith Harring type imagery. The bigger, more expensive one had windows and two lofts, but the smaller one had a tiny kitchen. I didn't like it but was loathe to spend $110,000 on an apartment instead of a house."
3463L,"I don't remember that much about it now but I know it was about houses, and I saw my friends Miles and Duncan in my dream too (they are dating now, and Duncan is my ex - we are all on good terms).

9455L,"I flew to Las Vegas for a friend's bachelorette party, where I somehow wound up in a NICU helping a new mom take care of her premie. I found cheap airline tickets and flew back and forth every weekend for a month, but for some reason the bachelorette party was still going on every weekend. When it was time to pack up and go home for the second-to-last time, I had way more stuff than I'd started with, including random outgrown kids clothes from my kids that I had been meaning to sell. In the process of packing and seeing the family with the baby, I wound up running late for my flight and as I was rushing to board, the dad showed up and asked me to bring some decaf tea back on my next visit. I ended up missing my flight and having to take another flight home, which was much more expensive and my husband was super annoyed. Throughout my dream I was washing my hands and using a ton of sanitizer, but nobody was wearing masks or social distancing, which I didn't notice until the end of the dream, and made note to bring my mask for the next trip."

I couldn't find my way to his office, but my job was located in the same building.

I didn't tell her we were supposed to be closed."
3824L,"I got a package in the mail. It was a pair of green sneakers. I was disinfecting the box but then I had to smash several stink bugs in the room. (They are a constant source of stress for me for 6 months of the year and I dream about them a lot)This caused me to wake up. The second dream, I went to Japan. I had my dog and he was able to roam the hotel with other dogs. I was excited to shop for Japanese beauty products. I rode a Segway type thing. There was some concern for masks at some point so coronavirus was still in the background."

3655L,"I had a weird dream about a large sea creature that overcame being hunted by throwing Its comrades (a whale or a cow? Something heavy) up into the air and creating whirlpools to get away.    Then I deampt about an animal sanctuary for small animals like cats and dogs; it was all outdoors, sunny, and and sepia toned. Everything was fine and the animals were really cute. Then, for some reason during a meeting, the computer became sentient, and sent images to the projector screen to communicate with us. Eventually a representation of the AI came out of the screen. He gave the humans trials but wasn't as smart as he thought. E.g. he had a person (Trump  but also not Trump for some reason? You know how dreams are) asked him to define a radioactive element (began with C? But couldn't. The man declared that he was stupid, as the word he can't define appears on the $20 bill, so why had he never bothered to look it up? We pulled out some 20s and pointed out that the word did not, in fact, appear on our currency. He looked like he was having a mental crises so I pointed out that we change our money all the time, and perhaps it was on an old version. I knew it wasn't though.    Later at the animal sanctuary, I was walking dogs, cats. Someone kept asking about naming an animal after my sister. I resisted at first, I think I was jealous. But then gave in and said to name a really cool one like a little dog (she likes those) or lynx after her and that she'd like it.     I also dreampt it was raining, and I was working on printing a large project (meanwhile other people also printed to the computer but my paper and settings were in there, so it printed their manuscripts incorrectly, e.g. printed sideways and hole punched all wrong) and a man (an academic mentor?) Came to check on me. I told him that I would have been in Japan, but wasn't so I was a bit sad (which is true, my flight was supposed to be yesterday but COVID-19 happened). I wanted to speak in Japanese to impress him, but I held back. I felt guilty for thinking he was attractive (since I have a partner IRL). He gave me reassurances about a variety of things, and offered to give me a ride home due to the rain."
3979L,"There was this house; and it was haunted (sort-of); parts of the second story were exposed to the elements. The whole dream had a murder-mystery vibe; and although someone was trying to harm certain people in the house (e.g. by setting part of it on fire or by scaring people when they were in the basement) it was not a scary dream (I love the horror genre. Haunting of hill house is highly recommended)  In another dream, I was in a club with my partner (male) and another girl started kissing him. I was drunk, and slurred ""keep your hands off him"" and was rude to her. Then; my partner in the club was a female who I had just started dating (e.g. this person was no longer my boyfriend) and she pointed out that this wasn't necessarily a date; and I agreed that monogamy is only applicable after having a conversation about being in a relationship and not just dating.   In the last part of my dreams; I was in a school (I think it was a high school? It was not somewhere I recognized) There was a kid on his bike, and I complemented him to boost his self-esteem. Later; I was socializing with peers and decided to work on a project rather than going out with people. The girl that was kissing my partner earlier in my dreams was there; and I apologized for being rude to her given that the person she had kissed was not ""officially"" in a relationship with me. She accepted my apology; she was very kind and pretty."

Suddenly the bears became interested in the car and as they approached, they turned into people. Their was suddenly a baby in a car seat in the car and the bear-turned-person asked if I would roll down the window so they could see the baby. That person started unbuckling the baby from the car set very quickly and was trying to take the baby and i was screaming and hitting the person and telling my fiance to drive....    In the second dream, and the details are very hazy, I just know that I was taking care of my younger brother (who has special needs in real life) and I was very scared that he couldn't be left alone because he is non-verbal and people will not understand him and he will become angry and push people when he is not understood. We were in some kind of waiting room and the dream was very stressful and I seemed to be racing with time."

When he arrived I had another guest over (she also wasn't anyone I know in real life but it felt like she was my friend in the dream). The guy hated her for some reason, so she quickly hid herself behind the curtains in my dinning room and stayed hidden until he left the house.    When he was leaving, he tried to kiss me. I turned my head quickly and said ""what the fuck? You know I'm a lesbian!"" He left without saying anything. Then, me and the girl chatted about everything that happened while seating in my living room."
16798L,"I had several dreams last night. In one of them, I dreamt I was simply watching random YouTube videos (videos that don't exist in real life) of a musical group I enjoy (I watched a lot of videos of this group that night before going to bed).    I don't remember most parts of another dream I had, but I remember 1 scene: I wanted to smoke some weed and I was in the bathroom of my house grabbing the weed and the weed grinder to roll a joint. The rolling paper was in my dad's bedroom, and I was a little embarrassed about asking him to give me some; the dream ended before I could do it. (in real life, I exclusively smoke weed in social contexts with friends. I've never smoked it in my own house and I have never rolled a joint by myself. My dad, who lives in our house, smokes weed, but I have never smoked with him. And he never leaves weed in the bathroom haha!).    The last dream I remember didn't involve me, i.e. I wasn't in the dream, it was like watching a movie. It was about a group of women prisioners that were in a mixed gender prison (I don't know if that exists in real life) but they wanted to go to a women-only prision. To do that, they had to record a creative video about themselves (kinda like people have to do to get in some reality shows in real life) and that's what they were doing in my dream."
19745L,"I had several dreams last night. The one I remember the most was about some friends of mine throwing a party. I didn't go and was worried about them catching Covid, but didn't say anything to them.    I had a few other dreams involving friends, colleagues from my university, and friends from my past.

It was strange because 1) we very rarely argue and 2) I haven't had any professional Zoom calls."
16412L,"I was on some kind of opera tour with a few other singers, and none of us seemed to have the right things to wear. I had underpacked the sort of comfortable dresses I usually wear, and somehow I'd packed a bunch of random costume pieces. A really catty girl I know from a training program kept commented that everything I had was too ""conservative"" for her to borrow because she needed something ""young"". She ended up wearing a stupid looking romper that was unfortunately in the same patterned fabric as one of my few viable dresses. I don't recall how this ended."
16722L,"There were lots of dreams but most recently, my husband and I were students at my elementary school, and we were each supposed to have birthday celebrations. I wasn't sufficiently organised because I'd slept over at a friend's and also forgotten my own birthday. And I had also left all of my textbooks and things at her house, including my face masks, so I couldn't even go in. I had to lay low in a corridor and eat cherry tomatoes from an old crudit√©s platter. Then somehow we were at a donor event where my old academic rival was being celebrated for a talk on climate change. I knew the talk was full of errors but I didn't dare say anything."

I bought some things for the apartment then went to a supermarket. My dad was working at a checkout line but then he got a page to go to another aisle. I waited for him to come and finish checking me out so I could leave but he wasn't coming back.
14683L,I was at a social event held at a convention hall. I was gathered with a few friends from highschool and sitting near the entrance. I met some of my friends from undergrad going into the convention hall and talked about them behind their backs with my highschool friends after they went in.
4687L,"Sarah, a neighbor my husband slept with yet is helping me in the court proceedings (yes, he's that much of a sociopath), stood at my garage door for days and determined the password to enter the house.  She was very open & proud of her accomplishment; but I immediately changed the password.   Later, I finally was invited by my husband to visit the apartment (for which I pay half) where he now lives.  In reality, I've never seen it.  In the dream, it was an old brick Victorian--is that possible?--atop a shop and his living room was round, inside a turret, with tall bay windows.  At one point, a photographer needed to photograph into the room from street level and he left me alone in my husband's apartment.  Only later did I realize I lost an opportunity to grab evidence.  Our cat sitter Blake arrived to take my husband to the airport. Although he surprisingly was speaking Japanese fluently and wearing a black sweatshirt with red and white kanji, the casual wear had a drawing of London's Parliament (red, white, & yellow) and my husband reluctantly told me he had to fly to London.  Suddenly, I'm sitting at an old friend's sparse apartment and asking him how his life has changed as a pirate of published works.  In real life, he helped invent the RealPlayer so never needs to work again.  He told me it's the same as 2003.  He just steals films and music; but now he owns every level of an Italian-style 1970s apartment building, which he rents to his ""buddies"" . Then I must've been bored, because I finally awakened."
11926L,"Now I only can recall my last dream, yet there were several throughout the night.    I was temporarily living in Rome and had a male roommate from NY.  (Now that my research has determined major-urban real estate should decline in value by 67%, I realized Manhattan may no longer be beyond my grasp; so right before bed, I was looking at rental rules for landlords, encountering new rent-control laws as well as co-habiting companies and their issues.)    It was about to be his first subway experience after the pandemic disappeared; so I asked him how he thought the layout would change.  I already had seen the aftereffects.    At first, he refused to predict what he would see.  Then I became more annoyed as he rattled off social distancing measures, when I explicitly had asked him how the space would change in a non-protective way.  He refused to think about it and soon we were at the doorway.    What I wanted him to ponder was how the real estate inside this dark cavern would be allotted with more folks out of work.  I wanted him to predict work-from-home status & blossoming crime would lead still-employed people to reside outside Rome proper, which would lead to far fewer subway riders and more open kiosk space/fewer vendors.  That extra space would be secured by smart people as storage space for the existing vendors, allowing them to operate with less hassle of hiding/carting home their visible stock at the end of the night.    Once inside the building, my roommate became female & we see my best friend from the womb--our moms were pregnant together and friends, too--working with her brother & his family selling wine just inside the doorway.  I was shocked.  My friend Linda always has the most incredible jobs.   Presently, she works alongside an Israeli billionaire chemist & doctor, working on cancer drugs.  Those companies are sold, once the FDA likes the results and then they proceed to the next cancer killing idea.  Before that job, she was the grant writer for Sean Penn.  In other words, she works well with difficult. powerful people and here she is in a dark subway selling wine?  She seemed happy, though.  She was in Rome, at least.    It was great to see them again; since we normally live so far from one another.  I had a horrible time introducing my roommate Jodie to them.  We kept being jostled by the emerging subway riders.    Then I noticed no one was buying wine; yet they were buying cigarettes, candy, snacks, water, & convenience store items from the neighboring kiosk directly opposing the staircase leading up to street level from the subway cars.  I realized location is everything, as well as serving the immediate needs of your clientele; since there no longer were wine aficionadi left in Rome. These were ""essential workers"" left to rush back and forth to menial jobs.  Then I started musing how artists would be the next inhabitants of Rome and what they would need amidst the rubble...  That's all I can recall."
12444L,"I just had them and now they are gone.  All I can recall is scaffolding, the kind underneath moveable bleachers in old high school gyms."
12907L,"I was given a paper ticket and told I must not lose it under any circumstances.  However, I did not know what it the ticket accomplished.  I was around acquaintances and soon someone led us into an old dark brown wooden stadium with a muddy middle and all sorts of horse jumping gymkana obstacles.  The entire venue looked too small for whatever would transpire.  We were seated in the stands. To much fanfare, the wannabe-royal Middleton family arrived.  I recall thinking the matriarch was wearing far too much ruffle for her age to be accepted by the higher staid society to which she aspired.    Soon the games commenced.  They were an amalgamation croquet & polo using  carriage horses.  Yes, it was too small, by design.  Many carriages were overturned, creating greater obstacles.    It was an attempt to bring folks back to outdoor group events after the pandemic by creating new yet familiar sports for fans."
13386L,"I barely recall, other than I constantly was getting the house ready for a video showing recording and fretting about it; because it will ensure my private life is not as private and all the legal ramifications with my estranged spouse, who is not allowed on the property.  This video will allow him access, in a way.  Hence, my dreams are replete with this issue."
13883L,"Of course, I could recall them each time I awakened and now, sadly, they are gone.  I just remember they had nothing concrete to do with the pandemic.  Life was proceeding normally...for a dream."
14309L,"It's all a blur now, but I remember awakening at 3:32 am and thinking, ""I've only been asleep for a little longer than one hour?""  I felt as if I dreamed forever.  Something about travel and an extra barrier we were forced against COVID-19 to wear that looked like a transparent plastic shower cap.  At one point, I passed a mirror and saw a spider crawling up near my forehead hairline, under the cap, and I was not allowed to remove the cap.  I'm not arachnophobic; but it was unsettling to try to remove it with my fingers as forceps, rather than a sweeping motion off my head."
14855L,"Something about dating & its stresses in COVID times.  Not that I am, but I must've considered it to dream about it."
15218L,"I found myself in Reykjavik with a male traveling friend Bradford from decades ago.  It was night the whole time we were there.  He had surprised me with this trip and I kept wondering how many days we were staying.  He never would answer that question when I asked.    At one point, we were doing our own thing and I ended up a little outside the main area of the city at a dance studio.  At that moment a very famous black male dancer was about to perform and I was backstage with the group, observing.  I did not recognize the name of his dance company, but he was from New York.  He was dancing with a heavyset yet very adept nude female in a very dramatic and syncopated fashion.  It was mesmerizing.    Backstage, I had put down my cell phone on a small Louis IV glossy wooden table stand with an overflowing plant taking up much of the space.  It looked like a Kindle, all wrapped in that fake leather binder, but with some heavy plastic off-white rounded retro-modern ""box"" under it, attached with a USB cord.    When it came time to leave, I picked it up and proceeded outside.  A double-decker silver bus with no roof was backing into a stall just past the door to the building.  Of all things, there was Bradford in the last seat.  I gingerly was able to step straight into the back of the bus and I expressed my surprise it was so easy to find him.    The bus took us into town and folks were talking about a surprise concert--I'm looking out the window as I type and I can see the first chipmunk of this year.  So beautiful!--that I wanted to attend.  Bradford is not enamored by music or anything not practical.  I tried to convince him it was possible & desirable, but did not know when we were leaving Iceland.  I tell him about the Sigur Ros performance I attended years ago in a Reykjavik high school gym; but he didn't know that band.  Then I told him of the GusGus event, where we all were smashed together, dancing in unison, tall girls' breasts gyrating into our backs; but, again, no reception. There was no convincing Bradford live music was worthwhile.    Suddenly we are ice skating indoors and he pulls out a bright yellow condom.  He said, ""I never know when I will need it, but I don't want to miss an opportunity.""  For a moment, I realize how long it has been since I've experienced anything sexual with another human, and I momentarily consider Bradford.  Then I realize it would change the travel dynamic.    After a few hours, I find my phone and realize this off-white attachment is not mine.  It's called a ""Just Jared"" (which I thought I never had heard of until I looked that guy up a few minutes ago) and Apple had considered it its first ""smart"" electronic machine.  I somehow knew it was worth US$500,000 and we spent the rest of the dream trying to find the owner.  I could not leave Reykjavik with it in my possession; but I did not feel ethical handing it to some stranger to not steal.  For some reason, the police were not an option.  I needed to find the actual owner to return it to him or her.    That's all I can recall."
15558L,Something about Italian lyrics and song structure.  I was trying to explain to a stranger how I believe Italian pop songs are closely related to operatic composition.  That's I can recall.
15988L,"Definitely COVID related, but nebulous on the details.  Something about looking for a place to live amid the impossible rules."
18806L,"There is a famous sexy male celebrity I know IRL. He wrote to me via email about an update of his arrival to Serbia via Albania.  Therefore, I dreamed I was helping him create a travel television series.  I was too old for him, so when a beautiful blonde 1920s-ish heiress named Charlotte arrived via bright yellow bi-plane to a desert setting where we were filming, I marveled how little jealousy I felt.  It made sense to me he would be interested in her.  As she landed, he was busy running with & using a javelin to throw himself into the sky.  He could jump hundreds of feet above the earth.  It was incredible!  He asked if I wanted to try and I was skittish; because I did not know how to land safely.  However I really wanted to try and began walking toward him.  That is all I can recall."
19126L,"Lots of dreams, but the only one I recall is I was following my (now-dead) mother through some backyard shed areas.  I marveled that she very recently awakened from a nap and immediately was walking to a neighbor's home to visit her.  I normally need to feel perfectly presentable.  Yet I followed my mom part of the way, through the mud.  She turned back to me and said, ""If you want a job, just hand your resume to a priest.  They know who needs a nurse.""  I awakened realizing it's probably true."
19942L,Something stressful about having to sell the house again.  I always get PTSD from moving domiciles.
22048L,"I only recall the end of the dream.  My dead father was driving.  I was in the passenger seat.  We were climbing south on a cliffside highway, such as Highway One between Carmel and Cayucos.  Suddenly we skidded on rubble and my side of the car was hanging off the cliff.  We hadn't fallen yet and I slowly was trying to lean toward my father, since his side of the car remained on land and not over the crashing waves hundreds of feet below us.  I could not endure the stress any longer and I awakened at 9:43 am."
125LB,"I just remember vague images, we were at an outdoor wedding (we'd actually been at an outdoor wedding that evening)"

14912L,Today is my day off.    Last night i dreamt that I went into work today anyway to update some case notes before going to get tested for covid. I was trying to hide that I was getting tested just in case my headaches (which I get often irl) were a sign of infection.     Almost every single.case i talk to has a headache first. In my dream i was worried about my cases and wanted to be sure they were okay if i had to be out of work.
21528L,"So many vivid dresnd3    1) masks dreams are back....it has been months ans no doubt it is tied to my governor( Texas) repealing all covid restrictions   - i was going into a phone store to look for my husband. He had gone in while i was in the shop next door. No one in the phone store was wearing a mask. Every where I turned there were unmasked swarms of people, must joking about covid.     2) i dreamt about the vaccine distribution. I forget the exact content.  Vaccines have been a huge part work recently...especially this week    3) i was at my grandmas house. My grandpa had died and the funeral was soon. I remember feeling so sad in this dream when we were leaving. The house seemed so lonely without him. I didn't want to leave my grandma alone    And in real life my grandpa died last summer. I couldnt see him in hospice or go to his funeral because of covid. Im honestly not sure the weight of it all hit me until this dream. I wont see him again.    I actually didn't fully process my great aunt's death until a similar dream yesrs ago too.    4) we packed our cats in a truck and needed to urgently get to Austin, Texas. At some point that turned into finding Baby Yoda washed up and cooing in a puddle if water. Then us trying to hide and protect him from a pushy couple who wanted to know our adopted baby's race and put mascara on the baby     5) trying to solve a murder..our ultimate solution was to test it out! I asked my husband to stab me and figured we could just restart my heart. I was dying in the dream, hoping our plan would worked   Then I woke up"
4974L,"Nightmare..but not sure why i would classify it as such, but somehow made myself wake up from it and usually only happens when dreams are nightmares for me. i was in a weird nursing school, like a building made up of hallways and very old passenger train cars. The instructors were strange, and often punished us physically for not answering questions the way they wanted us to. The punishment took some very twisted forms. i don't want to describe it because it was quite ugly."
5155L,i truly cannot recall the details; but they were not bad dreams or nightmares.
11664L,A lot of dreams and truly cannot remember them..they were hectic.
12571L,"Many dreams, but the one part of one that i remember well is one with one of my younger sisters, (i have 4, this one is second to youngest.) She is not one of my favorite people, and i am definitely not one of hers..in real life, and in the dream, i guess, as well. She has nice hair in both worlds: dream and real. i wound up with the shitty end of the hair stick in both worlds, at least in this dream. i wanted to know which products she uses to wash and condition her hair, as even though our hair is different as to it's appearance, it is sort of the same, in both worlds. She was more than willing to tell me the shampoo, but very hush-hush on the conditioner. It took some serious effort to pull it out of her, and then it was only because she said she knew i could never afford the conditioner in my lifetime. She showed me, and at first i was disconcerted seeing the price tag of 1200 on it. That would be out of my range both literally, and even if i decided to save for something, it would never be stupid conditioner..i could pay two of my kids rent for that amount..buy all of the grandbabies and kids presents..and i was just staring at it thinking how ridiculous, when i realized: the price was in pesos."
13033L,"i can only remember disparate elements: my daughter, my mother, my grandmother, water, running."
13278L,"i was in a forced communal living circumstance where i was not wanted to be a member of the household. i was locked out on two occasions. It was a strange place. There were babies that did not belong to the people, not being properly cared for, and i got into trouble for paying them attention and providing care. It seemed like i was not me, but someone else, at a much different age..maybe somewhere between 17-19 years old. i was frightened much of the time. i had a small corner where i could keep my things, but often had to stay outside on the front porch or in the garage to wait to be allowed in. The mother figure found me amusing, but did not like me very much, and the father figure was very threatening toward everyone. There were about 16-20 people there at any given time, not including the children and babies. It seems like human civilization had fallen apart, but i do not know why."
13560L,"So jumbled that it would be hard to characterize any one dream. But my younger, yet closest in age, sister played a part, and babies. Haven't seen my sister or talked to her in nearly 20 years. But i think of her daily, especially lately."
16491L,"Mostly nightmares. Had a son with my husband; we have not had children as he didn't want any, and i have 3 grown children already. We lost our son-it was unclear if he had died or just disappeared. That is the one i remember. The other caused me to wake up twice as each time i went back into it, but i cannot remember."

11686L,Dreamed about flying around an apartment but actually jumping and it was someone elses and being caught but scaring them.

But I couldn't get the sugar to spread neatly on top and i ended up accidentally folding  the sugar into it and just ruining the custard, trying to smooth it over and retorch it."
14284L,"I dreamed that three of my boyfriend's female cousins were getting married (nonexistent cousins in real life) and he was being very cruel about how greedy one was.  He said that if you had five dollars, she'd demand three of them, and I suddenly got Sia's Cheap Thrill's stuck in my head. I believe we then ourselves got married.

He was not someone discernable (meaning knowing him from my actual life). I stole my aunt's yogurt from a refrigerator. I was then at a concert watching 90s grunge bands and singing along.
4849L,I had emotional dreams. I dreamed about friendships that I have lost over the past 6 years. I saw all of them progressing in their lives while I felt stuck or frozen.

In this dream, she was asked to hang some art up in the store, but first she did it in her office instead. Then, our boss had to explain to her that it was wrong. When she hung it up in the right spot, they were crooked. I almost fixed them for her, but then I woke up."
4898L,"I had a dream that we were back in school, and I was teaching a class. Since I'm an assistant principal, I was actually covering for a class that a teacher was out sick. During the class, I confused some of the lessons and accidentally taught the 7th grade material to the 8th graders and it was embarrassing.     I also had a dream that I had taken about 5 students on a field trip. We were kayaking to some caves on the coast of California. We were able to park the kayaks and get out and explore some of the caves, and they were really neat. We all had a good time."

4919L,"Shallow streams of water in a vast dark space like a huge underground cavern. There are also simple cement constructions to hold and drain the water. I find a large Crayola art set lying in a few inches of water in one of the wide pebbly streams. [Day residue: yesterday brought home a box of things from my office, on top of which was a box of Crayola crayons and the molded plastic top for some other set of art supplies.] It contains an assortment of markers, bottles of ink, et cetera, and is about 2' x 3' in dimensions in length and width, but flat. I fish it out, thinking that probably a lot of the materials will be salvageable.      I also find a perfect pair of stud earrings with a pretty lavender stone. I think I found them in the stream initially, but later I am surprised to pull them out of my mouth. I feel other things in my mouth and pull out more earrings, then finally manage to get a grip on a large marble-like thing in the back left corner of my mouth. I pull out a bauble that it shaped like a skull. It has plaque or some other residue on it, and as I clean it off my tongue probes the empty area it left behind and realize that it had been embedded in my gum, and for a long time I had been unwittingly using it like a tooth. [Bleedthrough: I wore my nightguard to bed for the first time in a couple days, and that often leads to dreams where I feel weird things in my mouth that I try to pull out.]     Later, I was sitting outdoors on a grassy bank next to a brook, with two men. One was my father and one my butler. [Note: Obviously I have no butler in WL, and the character didn't remind me of anyone.] The two men are drinking a clear liquid like sake from organically shaped cups. [DR: last night I had a few sips of sake from a small handmade clay cup.] Meanwhile I am kneading and pinching a material in my hands into a large round cup-like shape. The material is like a very soft clay, but smooth and slick in texture, and has a wonderful opalescent play of varying dark colors. It feels very sensual to touch and mold.     My father asks if I remember how my grandmother's house was rearranged long ago. [Dream logic: the house in question was that of my maternal grandmother, but in the dream the implication is that it was his own mother.] My answer confirms his own recollection, helping him win a bet he had made with the butler. After that, while his attention is elsewhere, the butler offers me a sip of the liquid in his cup, a sly and intimate gesture. Our eyes meet and I feel a surge of desire."
5018L,"I was in my bedroom in the house where I lived as a teenager. Several guests were staying over at the house. Most were vague, random DCs, but one was a current colleague, along with his wife and child. [Day residue: I've been meaning to email him for the last couple weeks to check in, so he's been on my mind. In WL he has three children, but apparently this overtaxed my dreaming imagination, so it was reduced to one.]     There was something I wanted to show to the guests, so I invited them into my bedroom. Everyone was sitting together on the bed. [Distortion: in WL it was a tiny daybed pushed up against the wall. In the dream it was magnified to a large king-sized bed in the middle of the room.] The guests appeared uncomfortable, and I realized that this must be because I had covered all the windows and mirrors with paintings that I had made on plywood panels, with the face of the paintings hidden and only the backs showing. This darkened the room and gave it a funereal atmosphere. [DR: I was reading recently about the art installation Die Familie Schneider, and I think the review mentioned that the paintings were turned toward the wall, creating an ominous atmophere.]     I went around the room and removed the paintings from the mirrors and windows, storing them behind the dresser with the images out. They were all self-portraits in various styles. [DR: Last semester I made self-portraits on plywood panels just like this as a class project, though the actual imagery was different in the dream. And just last night I discovered Nina Katchadourian's series Lavatory Self-Portraits in the Flemish Style, some of which were so clever they made me laugh aloud.]     When I removed the painting blocking the window, which was much larger in the dream than it was in life, the view it revealed was gorgeous: a misty landscape with a soft pink glow, so I invited everyone to look. I realized I needed some way to amuse myself while the guests were here, and I wouldn't be able to sustain the attention to read a proper book, so I grabbed a strategy guide to the video game I'm currently playing. [DR: I was reading some online strategy guides to the game last night before bed.]     Suddenly the guests all left the room in a way that felt awkward and abrupt. I wondered what had happened, and realized that I was topless. I had felt so relaxed and casual in my own bedroom that I hadn't thought to cover up in the presence of other people. I didn't feel embarrassed, but I felt sorry that I had apparently embarrassed them. I had neglected to consider that my colleague is a conservative Catholic, and the other guests might have been as well.     I got up to leave the room when I heard my colleague's wife yelling at him just outside the door-apparently they were staying in the closet that was located right outside the room. I decided it would make them more embarrassed if I appeared while they were arguing, so I decided to stay inside until it was finished.     After I sat back down on the bed, two or three women came in. They were archaically dressed as though from some ultra-conservative religious order, and even wore head coverings. [DR: this might also have been influenced by the Katchadourian pictures.] They promptly began remonstrating me for a trio of small works of embroidered text I had on the wall. [DR: Yesterday took note of the sewing sampler in the corner and was also shown a small embroidered bag.]     The women complained that these images were sacred in their religion, and it was wrong of me to have them. I explained that I had found them at Goodwill and recognized that they were sacred, so my intent had been to save them from destruction. [NOTE: I actually dreamed about a thrift store earlier in the night, but cannot confirm if these items were present.]     The women said that the images were meant for a sacred purpose, and if that purpose was no longer fulfilled, then it was right for them to be destroyed. I apologized, and told them that if they wanted, I would give them the images to put back to use or destroy as they saw fit. I reassured them that I understood their point of view, that I was a Buddhist, and so although our beliefs might be very different-I paused to explain that Buddhism does not require any specific beliefs, emphasizing rather the importance of doing the right thing-I had also sometimes felt powers active in the world. I finished the dream with a long theoretical monologue defending animistic attitudes toward both sacred objects and stuffed animals, the sorrow I felt toward both when I saw them abandoned and degraded, and my desire to rescue and redeem them. [DR: The article I read last night talked about the ""biographies of objects"" and included a footnote discussing the articles by Appadurai and Kopytoff that had made a big impression on me in grad school.]    I concluded by using my stuffed toy lion in demonstration. ""This was given to me by a dear friend of the family when I was one or two years old. It has always reminded me of her, and over the years I've imbued it with all the love I felt for her. Now that she's dead, it helps me remember her... and it feels like it has taken on a life of its own."" I looked in the eyes of the toy and was struck to see that they actually gleamed like the eyes of a living creature. The two women nodded sympathetically, and I felt like we had bridged our differences and reached a shared understanding."
5559L,"Vague grey interior space, with two otherwise featureless rooms I am supposed to be terraforming. I examine my progress and find that little is growing in the first room, and the only thing flourishing in the second room are dry, spiky plants resembling thistles. This does not appear to be ideal results. The thistles are producing long, coarse fibers that resemble thick woolen yarn, so I start collecting big handfuls of these fibers and strewing them around the floor in the first room. I think they might help by serving as mulch or nesting material for small animals. I make sure to leave handfuls at the base of the bookshelves where mice might be sheltering. (The walls of the first room are lined with bookshelves; not sure if they were at first.)     I notice that the pants I'm wearing are producing the same kind of long woolen fibers, so I grab additional handfuls from them and strew them in the room. The pants I'm wearing have been fashioned from broad leaves that have been bundled together. I reflect that I never would have worn this kind of attire before the pandemic, but it is actually rather comfortable. I like the way the leaves torque and swish as I walk."
11952L,"First sleep:     I was in Bangkok, in a windowless room that opened into an enclosed mall. It was a wide room that accommodated about 6-8 rows of chairs arranged neatly on two sides of a central aisle, with other aisles around the outside. One could sit in the chairs to watch a Buddhist service taking place in the front of the room. I wondered what kind of service it was, because it was very atypical of Theravada Buddhism to have the audience sit in chairs in a commercial space like this, and the monks were wearing simple black robes. Had I seen Japanese monks in such robes? It was definitely something Mahayana. But Bangkok is getting more diverse all the time, so Mahayana practices are not unknown. I sat on the right, maybe in the second row about three seats in (this is my best guess and not an exact recollection of my position). There were other audience members seated around me, so the chairs were at maybe 35-50% capacity.     Suddenly I realized... wasn't I forgetting something? Oh yeah, COVID-19 was still in play! And here I was sitting in an enclosed room full of people, and none of us were wearing masks! I knew Bangkok hadn't been that badly hit, and that not just proximity but length of exposure was a probable factor... how long had I been sitting there? I reckoned it had been about half an hour. That wasn't too bad, but probably this would be a good time to leave, just in case. I got up and walked out into the main mall area.     Just before waking:     I was looking at the full-page ad on the back of a magazine cover for ""Haunted Plum Mead."" This was becoming a popular drink, so through common use, the word was already contracting: now people said it like ""Haunted Plummead,"" but it was still formally written with the space.    The ad showed a tall glass bottle poised to pour its contents into a glass, and there was a ghostly image of the same bottle behind it, and maybe some plums in the background. As I looked, the images began to move: the plums and the ghostly image merged into the real bottle, which also became white and glowing, as the liquid began to pour into the glass."
12573L,"Poorly remembered fragments that I jotted down over the course of the night:     A bumbling character named ""Bimby,"" that I thought I recognized from a TV show. He suffered a condition called ""hyperpauticy,"" which I understood was a form of lycanthropism.     I was flipping through the table of contents of a book. I needed to read and copy three chapters before class: I had a few hours, but would it be enough time, given how slowly I read? Then I was relieved to remember that classes are over.    By the sea, puddles of water on the ground. I see an bookmark decorated with the image of an octopus in cross-stitch lying in the street. I want to pick it up and keep it, but I don't know if it belongs to someone, so I reluctantly leave it there.     I'm a middle-aged man in a big eighteenth-century bed. I should check on my wife, invite her to join me, but I hesitate - I need to read.     I'm in a haunted house with long hallways. It is a kind of game: I know that the encounter will not activate until I enter a certain area. I just want to use the bathroom, but I see a figure moving in a room at the end of the hall and worry that I've activated the antagonists. Although I still have to pee, I don't want to push my luck so I retreat back to the safe room, locking the door behind me."
13036L,"An old riverbed. On both banks were huge primitive plant growths and other growths that had been parasitic upon them, and partly mimicked their shape. Now they had been adapted into architecture, a tourist attraction.     Academic Assembly was about to begin, and I was relieved to remember that it was no longer my responsibility to count quorum. People were going to be assembling down on the football field, and I was reminded of the things rumored about it: that underground they sensed something alien, like an ancient contract steeped in the very earth, betokening total domination by outside forces. Some surmised that the parasitic relationships were also alien, of the same era, though less one-sided.     Though others spoke of these things, I could not sense them in the earth. I reflected that all I could truly feel were the living trees. Would I sense it if one were dead? I thought it likely."
13514L,"I had a handful of tiny seeds, so I scattered them in the garden. Nothing was currently growing there, though some furrows had been prepared, and I wondered if my mother had been planning to plant something. Normally I would keep an eye out for my seedlings as they sprouted and transplant them as needed, but I realized I wasn't sure exactly what these little plants would look like.      [Day residue: Yesterday morning my mom mentioned that she had been working in the garden, and in the afternoon I planted some random dandelion and coriander seeds and wondered if I should try planting the tiny ajwain seeds I've been using as a seasoning.]"
13968L,"I was in my grandma's house, and a number of strangers were congregated in the living room and kitchen. I walked with my husband to the back of the house, and as we went through the short hall into my grandma's bedroom, I realized this was a dream, although I never became fully lucid. I admired the extent to which the structure of the house had been accurately reproduced, although a lot of the furniture was unfamiliar and wrongly placed. I pointed around the room, telling my husband: ""This is where my grandma's bed used to be, and the TV was there, and that side of the room was a long closet."" He walked toward a corner of the room where the dream had accurately reproduced her dresser, and I saw him dodge an obliquely angled coffee table in the middle of the floor that shouldn't have been there. ""Do you see that too?"" I asked, curious if he was seeing it exactly the way I was dreaming it, given that he had never been in that house. [Dream logic: I was not lucid enough to realize that as a DC, he could not have perceptions independent from my own.]      There was a box in front of a dresser containing a hard drive, and my husband was carrying a different hard drive in a satchel. They contained important information, and I watched as he either switched one for the other, or added the new one to the one he already had. [Day residue: yesterday my husband mailed two hard drives containing important information.] It felt like a spy movie plot, like we had to keep our actions secret. As he was kneeling over the box, there was a knock at the door. We hadn't locked it because we didn't want to seem suspicious, so I hurried over and opened it a crack to see a little girl. I slipped out of the room, only opening the door far enough to let my body through while blocking her view inside, and closed the door behind me so we could talk in the hall. She said she wanted me to make her more warm milk (apparently I had done so earlier). Although she was affecting a childish tone, I thought she seemed older than her years, and suspected that her real intentions had been to find out what we were up to. I deliberately led the girl away from the room and toward the kitchen, hoping to give my husband enough time to finish up whatever he was doing with the hard drives.      I found a saucepan in the sink that was not ideal for heating milk (too shallow), but figured I could make do, and tried to wash it, but it was covered with stubborn grease and stuck-on food so I gave up. I was in a hurry to rejoin my husband, so I tried giving the girl a mug of cold milk from the fridge. She complained that she wanted it warmed, so I stuck the mug in the microwave and set the timer for two minutes. I told her to get it out herself when it was done, or ask another adult to get it for her if she couldn't reach, because I needed to go. My husband had come into the kitchen so we affected a casual demeanor but walked straight out the front door and got into a silver, futuristic-looking car in the driveway. This part was tense because we thought it was only a matter of time before someone caught on and tried to stop us. But we drove the car quickly up the rural road into the woods, and once we were out of sight of the house, we set it on flight mode and took off into the sky.     There was a bit of proceduralism here where I OOCly tried to figure out if the car needed a straight bit of road like a runway or to reach a certain speed before taking off. I decided I should stop overthinking things and just allow that we were flying now, and it was so. Since dream awareness was heightened again at this point, and I wondered if I should just skip ahead to our destination or play through the whole journey. The dream seemed stable and flying was fun, so I decided to go along with it. Our destination was somewhere in Vermont, and I was trying to think how long it would actually take to reach it from where we had started in central southern New York. I remembered how long it used to take to drive to Montreal from central New York and figured this journey might be roughly the same length, but a flying car might quarter the travel time. Because of the current of my thoughts I think the destination was revised to Montreal, but the world below was urban and futuristic so the destination was an abstraction anyway. I wondered if my husband had programmed our flight path into the computer or if, to avoid the risk of surveillance, he was navigating by hand.     For a while the car was flying low over a dystopian city, and at times we were practically in the streets. There were various encounters that I don't clearly remember. And then we were back in the air and passing over parking garages that had been designed for flying cars: they contained a black geometric pattern that operated like a QR code as our vehicle passed over it, so that our screen prompted us to enter landing coordinates, but at the same time warned that these would reveal our position to the authorities. So we took care not to fly directly over these buildings."
14425L,"A game-like dream: my character was a female warrior. The landscape was not realistic, perfectly flat plain bounded by blocky mountains. My perspective alternated between first person and map view. I was exploring the plain until I came across a town (identified by a raised dot on the map) on a low hill.     In the town was a vendor, so I was going through his stock, which took the form of a pull-down menu. As I compared the options, I accidentally clicked on ""Vampire"" and bought one, without even knowing how much I spent. Luckily there was an ""undo"" button, because the vampire cost 100 gold (which was the majority of what I had) and I had no use for it. After undoing that purchase, there were two others that I was considering: ""Stalker,"" an undead creature that the explanatory text said moved slowly but was good at smelling out treasure, or ""Baby,"" which was less expensive but had only half the sense of smell. I decided to purchase two stalkers, because between the pair of them, they were certain to lead me to the treasure I sought.     The stalkers were released onto the map as soon as I purchased them, so I didn't have time to further peruse the vendor's inventory, but had to run after them. Even though they supposely moved slowly, they had a head start and I had a hard time catching up. It seemed like they could run almost as fast as I could! I decided to take a second to mount my horse, which moved faster than I could on foot, and then I could keep up with them easily.     The stalkers led me back toward the mountains from which I had come, but further along the range to an area I had missed, where there was a big castle. I realized the treasure must be in there, and was glad that my purchase had paid off. The stalkers disappeared into the castle, and I followed them, but guards soon attempted to detain me. I fought them off easily, and then was challenged by the king, whose red color marked him as hostile. I slew him promptly and without second thoughts - I was in a hurry to catch up with my stalkers! In the process I accidentally wounded one of the resident monks, which I felt a little bad about since they were non-combatants, and that led to more guards chasing me, but they weren't a real threat so I dispatched the few near me and hurried on, evading the ones that were further away.      Although I had lost sight of the stalkers in first-person view, I could see their progress on my map, so I took the same route through a series of corridors that led into a big open hall. There were many minor treasures along the way that I stuffed in my pockets: decorative medallions on ribbons that were non-magical but probably worth a bit of cash, and two different jewelry displays that each contained two pairs of stud earrings with different gems. I thought the latter might be magical but in my haste I had no time to inspect them closely or try them on, so I also shoved them in my pockets for later. I thought it was interesting that the earrings here all came in fours: it must be the fashion in this country to wear two matching sets at once.     I was heading toward a gold dot that appeared on my map, marking the location of the main treasure at the far end of a large hall: it was the ""Sang R√©al."" As I neared the treasure hall I was confronted by a father, mother, and teenage daughter, Asian immigrants, who were its caretakers, and determined to protect it. I had no wish to harm them, since they posed no threat, so I continued through the hall and opened the chest that contained the treasure. Inside the large chest was a tray containing a small box that fit in my palm: this contained the precious object.     ""What is it?"" I asked the family of caretakers. I could tell they were stocked and slightly offended that had barged in so aggressively to loot something that I didn't even know much about. (OOCly I did know what the treasure was, but ICly my character didn't know, a mental disparity that felt just like it would have in a WL RPG.)     They explained that the Sang R√©al was the blood of the god. Some believed that the one who drank it would also become a god, but only if they were pure of heart. My character reflected cynically that it would be awesome to become a god, but she had no illusions about the purity of her heart, so she was not tempted. The family appeared so devoted and sincere, she realized with a sinking feeling that she was not going to walk out with the treasure after all: what would be the point, if she couldn't actually use it? Something like this was too marvelous to just sell for a bit of cash. Moreover, it was evident that they were willing to lay down their lives to protect it, and as callous as she was, she couldn't bring herself to kill this family.  So she quickly resigned herself to leaving the Sang R√©al behind, but decided to let the family go through the motions of talking her out of it.     ""Don't you want to try it?"" the father asked me. I thought he must be tempting me deliberately: knowing that my heart was not pure, and I would die if I drank the god's blood. But when we opened the small box, it contained a silver pendant on a chain. The pendant had the form of a stylized animal mask, like a taotie. I wasn't going to drink anything, but I let him put the chain around my next. The pendant hung down at waist level, and transformed into a large black war belt. I realized that it was taking a form that revealed the essence of my character. I admired the magic and gave it back.    The father wanted to try it on next. He started commenting that he is pure: he never even had sex. I responded skeptically: ""But you have a daughter!"" ""Yes,"" he admitted, but protested that he had never figured out how it works. I worried that he might be tempted to drink the blood. When he put the chain around his neck, the pendant transformed into a large silver styled ship. I wondered if the pendant revealed the kind of gods we would be if we did successfully drink the blood, our area of influence. War made sense for my character, and travel for his, given that he had come to this land as an immigrant.     I noticed that only the father and daughter were next to me: the mother was still on the far end of the hall. Were they deliberately stalling me while she tried to get help? But if it came to a fight I thought I could take on the guards, so I lingered to indulge my curiosity.    The daughter tried the pendant next. She put it on backwards, and it transformed into a loose silk robe. Across the back of it was printed lines of text, narrating a story that I realized told her future. It suggested that she was destined to become a devotee of the god of healing (possibly named ""Makris"") and aid her village. I wondered why anyone would want to know their future-but at least it seemed to be a positive one, and maybe discovering it will give her a sense of purpose and direction.     I convinced her to wear the pendant in the front so we could see what emblem it would transform into. It turned into a sort of leather toolbelt and apron marked with measurements that the father identified as a fishwife's belt. I figured that might become her day job. The father and daughter now suggested that I wear the pendant backwards like a robe, just as the daughter had done initially. I protested that I didn't want to know my future, but curiosity made me give in. The man wrapped the cloth around me, and to my dismay I found myself completely bound in a sheathe of fabric, lying flat on the floor, my arms pinned at my sides, just as a flurry of guards burst into the room.    Had the family pretended kindness only to betray me? I thought it very likely and cursed myself for trusting them... until the guards went out another door, they freed me from the cloth, and I realized that they had wrapped me up to conceal and protect me. My anxiety about betrayal melted into trust and gratitude, and I was glad that I had dealt gently with the family. At this point, there was no way I was going to make off with their treasure, so I returned the treasure to them. Though giving it up stung I little, I consoled myself by thinking, hell, if I change my mind I can always invade the place again someday. But I didn't think it likely. I also felt a new sense of purpose, and told the girl that I also intended to honor the god of healing. After all, I reflected, this was very compatible with my primary god of war!    I was about to leave the castle, but as the scene ended the game suggested a specific upgrade to my character. This led me to discover an upgrade interface I hadn't known about before. I already had three points to spend, so I wondered if I had missed this feature earlier in the game. The interface let me scroll through various upgrades that would specialize me into a class. I started comparing the benefits of each class. Hunters got special mounts and animal companions, but I was happy with the default mount. I tried to find the upgrade that the game had suggested, and thought it might be one of the druid options. I was still fiddling with this interface and reading the details of the different options when the dream ended."
14807L,"I was shopping in a nice boutique. As I was kneeling to examining some item, a guy came over to help me. I recognized him as a good friend from back in high school who I haven't seen in many years. He was so close I feel his breath on my face as he spoke, and it provoked an ambivalent reaction. I knew I should tell him to stand further away, but I was enjoying the closeness, so I hesitated.     ""It's only risky if he has the virus,"" I thought, then reminded myself, ""But I can't know that... that's why it's risky."""
15236L,"At a craft brewery somewhere near a forest. After getting some drinks, my friends and I were hanging out on two bare mattresses on the floor in a side room, waiting our turn to buy some extra brews to bring home. It was taking a really long time, like more than an hour, and eventually we started thinking we would just head home empty-handed. I was reclining on a mattress on one side of the room talking to D (an old friend from high school), and two other friends (vague DCs, no connection to WL) were on the other side. He mentioned that he had no way home because he hadn't brought his car, and I eagerly offered to give him a ride. It would be nice to have someone to talk to on the long drive back - even if his house in Marion was another hour to the west of mine, which was already two hours away (I felt like we were in central NY, somewhere east of Syracuse).     [Note: D had lived about an hour west of me, I think, but was ""Marion"" really the name of the town? I have that uncertainty that one wakes up with, not sure if a dream detail is real. I can't think of any other possible names for the town where he lived, so I will now look up ""Marion"" to see if it is a real place:    [Google confirms that ""Marion"" is indeed a town about a half hour west of where I lived at the time, so I'm going to propose that this is a real memory and it was actually the placed D lived.]    There was a guy who worked at the place who was dressed in a primitive style. [WLR: late last night watched new videos by Danheim and Wardruna that featured men dressed like this.] I was asking him about an event they held in the woods nearby, somewhere in between a LARP and reenactment of Iron Age life.     ""What is your policy on edges, points?"" I asked her, wondering if I should specify that I was talking about weapons, but figuring she would get it. I use ""she"" now because in the course of the conversation, the person I was talking to had transformed from a bearded guy in primitive garb to an elegant, dark-haired Goth woman in a corseted red and black dress. In classic dream fashion, I did not notice any change. I don't know if it was the same person (because the place changed too, from inside the room to outside the building) or if there was just a missing transition, but it felt like the same conversation had continued without missing a beat.    ""They're fine,"" she said, and I was pleased by their commitment to realism. Maybe I would come back and take part.    ""What do you call your group?"" I asked her.    ""Royals of Chaos,"" she answered. I made a mental note to look it up online when I was back at my computer.     But while I had been talking to her, D had walked off into town with another guy. They were now out of sight, so I excused myself and hurried after them. The road into town was one of those narrow European streets with no sidewalks, just the abrupt transition from a one-lane stone-paved street to two- or three-storey buildings on both sides. I tried to remember where I had parked... I thought that up ahead the street would open into a plaza, and then if I hooked a sharp left I would find my car, but I wasn't sure.     I wanted to text D to let him know I was still planning to give him a ride, but when I pulled out my phone I had no signal. In the upper-left corner of the screen there were no bars at all, just the words ""NO CRAFTING.""     I realized I would be annoyed if D had gotten a ride home with the other guy, just because I had lagged behind for a few minutes. We had made an agreement, and it would be rude to break it without telling me. Moreover, since I did offer to give him a ride, now I wouldn't be able to leave until I tracked him down, because I couldn't very well go if there was any possibility he might be waiting for me."
15579L,"A guy handed me a hard copy of an article on the use of wood in Chinese art. ""Impressions in Wood"" was part of the title, and the author was Richard Graze. [Not a real person.]     ""Thanks,"" I said. ""I don't think I've seen this one. Does it talk about woodblock printing?""     ""Hardly at all,"" he answered.     I started flipping through the article, and at first I had the impression of looking at text on paper, stained with colored washes as though highlighting had been done in red watercolor. Soon the content of the article became immersive, a new dream.    It described rituals of human sacrifice. The sacrifice was supposed to be voluntary, but I reflected that people might be motivated less by religious devotion than by fear or anxiety of being left in the world without any means of support, like the ""voluntary"" self-immolation of widows in premodern India.     The article did mention that it was possible to refuse to be sacrificed, and those who opted out were entitled to receive alms called ""poldina,"" which took the form of pieces of split wood, about a foot long and two inches thick, that would have been used to light the pyre. I wondered if this explained the etymology of the word ""poltroon."""
16116L,"I'm shopping in a small boutique, trying on a glamorous coat. It is dark brown and so long it nearly touches the floor, the lower half flaring like a skirt. I ask the woman who works there how much it costs, and she is evasive. I had been guessing $250 or so, but she is so hesitant to tell me the price I suspect it must be much more. ""Is it $1000?"" I ask, trying to gauge her reaction to see if my guess is close to the mark. I realize that I should decide on a hard spending limit before she answers, so I don't get upsold. I'm quite taken with the coat, but how much would I really be willing to pay?     Suddenly I realize that I am not wearing a mask, and neither is anyone else in the store, and we haven't been paying attention to social distance, either. What is going on? How could I have gone out without a mask? The only times I've forgotten to wear mask in public since this thing started all turned out to be dreams, but this isn't a dream, is it? Is it?    [Note: I didn't even have time to RC before waking consciousness resurfaced, and I realized that of course it *was* a dream a moment too late to hold the scene together. Being in public without a mask has apparently become a new dream sign. It's odd that so many of these dreams involve shopping for clothing in nice boutiques, something I almost never used to do in waking life.]"
24210L,"It was raining heavily, and I was naked on the street in Japan, my hair (longer than in life) a heavy, sodden tangle on top of my head. Two Japanese girls approached me and I apologized for my condition. One spoke to me in Japanese and I just happened to understand her perfectly and responded fluently, which pleased me, but then I thought they would be disappointed if they continued to speak in Japanese and realized my ability was very limited. They took me to a kitchen where we all put on light blue uniforms and prepared to cook. She started giving me instructions in Japanese, and switched to English when they got complicated, so we didn't have any communication difficulties. We were making noodles in a bucket, mostly by hand but using a press with holes in it (Western-style, in contrast to stretching the noodles after the usual Asian fashion). I made both thin noodles and thick ones (swapping out presses with differently sized holes), and I was pleased how well they were turning out, since I had not used this method before. The first girl laid her noodles near a fire to firm up, and I set mine aside to wait until there was room to follow suit. I wasn't sure if I had accidentally started a new job, or if this was just a one-off class I was crashing, but I was enjoying the process of learning a new skill."

5310L,My neighbor was on my roof trying to come in and in the dream this was a normal way that he would come over to my house.

This window was in the foyer and the foyer ceiling was two stories high so we were on the second floor I had to climb over the railing and around the walls to get to the window to be able to open it.

The concert was about to start and I became worried about finding my spouse and whether they were ok.  There was lots of wine at the party but I don't drink anymore so I was going to get some water or soda. The pandemic wasn't happening so nobody was wearing masks or concerned about social distancing."

The other side of the suite had a skylight. I was excited to have a chance to live the undergrad experience again and was eager to make friends. I was unpacking and getting to know my roommates when I woke up."
14579L,"I dreamed that I was standing at a gas pump with my sister when a large, muscular man at the opposite side of the pump struck up a conversation with me about the weather and my outfit. I responded in a friendly manner, and then realized something was horribly wrong and that he was trying to get me off guard. I started moving toward my car door but he grabbed me from behind with his arms around me like a ""bear hug"" and started moving with me toward the back of his car while I tried to struggle and screamed ""Myra!"" (to get my sister's attention) and screamed ""Help me! Help me!"" (to get anyone around's attention). But it was to no avail and he was too quick and strong and was pushing me into his car trunk and started to shut the lid over me. As the lid started to close over me I woke up in panic covered in sweat and I couldn't get back to sleep for over an hour."
16652L,"I dreamed at least three separate times that I tried to make our online grocery order for the weekly curbside pickup only to realize that I was dreaming and would have to do it again for real when I woke up. I also dreamed I was standing across the street from a polling place on Election Day with my mother, drinking coffee from a coffee shop and people watching in general, when an election official grabbed me by the arm and dragged me over to try to get me to vote. I explained that I voted early and didn't need to vote today, but I was scared because she wasn't wearing a mask and was breathing in my face. I wasn't wearing a mask because I had actively been sipping a coffee away from people outside the coffee shop. When she let go of my arm, two older men who looked kind of like movie villains looked at me and quietly made a disgusting antisemitic remark about bribing Jewish voters with shiny dimes, and I realized they were election officials. I walked away from them in disgust and was about to report their comment to the person at the check-in desk when I woke up from that dream.  I also dreamed that I was milling about outside my apartment complex on a nice day and realized that all the university students were leaving town and abandoning their furniture on the apartment complex lawn. I started poking around looking for good pieces to take home and then remembered that we don't need any furniture and that we are doing well enough financially now that we can buy what we need without having to scrounge other peoples' garbage. Then I woke up."

Last night the dream had to do with being in the states and a friends bookstore is closing down, apparently I had a lot of my things there in storage and I would have to pack up my things and take them with me, possibly back to Trinidad. There were so many other things I wanted to take from there like 11X17 reams of paper. My wife was with me and she also was excited to choose new books to bring back with us. The store is by a dry river and suddenly the weather turns and  rain falls and the river gets flooded, it invades the bookstore and we could only hold on to a handful of things as we watched the rest of our things get washed out by the flood."

6072L,"I had three vivid dreams last night. The first was an ABBA/1920's dream. I was in a mansion by the sea and all the lights had a soft glow. It was impossible to go outside, but the house was so large that didn't seem to matter to anyone. I was with a group of about 50 people and everyone was drinking and singing and dressed like the 1920 elite. The mom in my dream was not my actual mom, and she kept trying to get me to go out and entertain the guests by singing abba songs. I refused. My room had a pool and in the center was a floating piano bar with a mermaid trapped in it. She gave better advice than my mom. My boyfriend showed up and we started to walk about of the room. I wanted to stop walking out and he kept moving me. I repeatedly told him to stop and he just laughed. I started crying and we moved into a side room where he apologized and said he didn't know I was that serious about not walking out to sing abba. We left the room and he started forcing me to walk ""as a joke"" and I punched him. I said sorry and went into a closet alone, only the closet was a rainforest. Then the dream changed and I was riding my bike to my old house. It was windy and I had trouble opening the garage door to store my bike, but my sister came to help and we got it open and closed again quickly. The garage was cozy once the wind was blocked out. My sister said she had a surprise, so we opened the door to the backyard and her two dogs were outside! I was so happy. Two new dogs were there as well, and they instantly loved me. One was a red healer and the other was a cute mix of boxer and husky. We all sat down to take a picture in the wind and drool was everywhere but I had my sister's dogs on either side and the two new dogs laying in front of me. We were all very happy. Then the dream changed again. I was in my ex boyfriends apartment. His roommate was playing video games and my ex was talking to me as I was leaning over a sink cleaning my teeth with a small dirty mirror nailed to the wall. He was talking about some card game, but I wasn't listening because my teeth were a mess! I was so angry at my dentist for letting me walk around with my molars half out of their roots and two of my front teeth were filed down to tiny shards. My ex kept talking and I kept flossing and brushing and silently begging my teeth to stay put. Then I woke up."
6378L,"I only remember one dream. I was skiing through a wooded area that wasn't frequented by other skiers. As usual I was just trying to keep up with my sister. I stopped to catch my breath when I hear music to my right. Two snowboarders burst through a cave in a powder explosion! They don't stick the landing but they're cheering as if they did. The cave must have been cool. I decide to keep skiing down the steep and lumpy powder filled slope to catch up with my sister. I make a left turn and as I swing my head round to stick out my right turn I see a dead body kind of obscured at the base of a lump. I decide that the lump is just a tree covered by a ton of snow. There was a lot of blood. All of this happened in an instant because I didn't stop. As soon as I registered the body, I had already completed my right turn and I was on my left. I was freaked out. I kept going because I knew the body was dead and there wasn't anything I could do to help. So I promise the poor body that I'll tell ski patrol and they can get it out. The rest of the way down the mountain wasn't fun, and the big jump before reaching the base wasn't satisfying but it looked super cool. I find ski patrol before my sister and I tell them where I saw the body. Ski patrol is super nonchalant and the guy said people keep telling them about it every few weeks but they can't find the body when they go to look. I feel pretty disgusted by ski patrol and tell myself to never die on the mountain. I go to look for my sister and I still can't find her. After what felt like a few hours I conclude that she left with her guy friends. I find my old scientist friends, that apparently I have, and they invite me to dinner at their lodge. The table sat about 8 people and we all tucked in to countless dishes of corn. I ate a corn pudding but politely refused the rest. The guy to my right was eating as much corn as he could, it was fascinating to watch. The scientists serve corn free wine and I'm so thankful for something other than corn that I finish a bottle by myself. I tell the table about the dead body I saw earlier and one of the scientists slams a button on the table and the whole table with all the guests shoot down into an underground lab. There are tanks filled with blue bubbling water all along the walls. I look closer at one of the blue tanks and corn is inside. It looks slimy and wrong. The scientists tell me that the body I saw belonged to a spy that had been brutally murdered. I don't feel surprised. The scientists then tell me that I have to go back and try to catch the group that killed the person at night. That seems to make sense to me, but I tell them that the terrain is difficult and the only person that could ski that is my sister. The scientists don't seem happy about that but they agree and give me a friend to help me go find my sister. He's a damn attractive spy guy that had been standing in the shadows during dinner. I agree to take him with me. Then the dream got confusing because suddenly I was applying to office jobs with my hot sidekick spy. I go to scope out one office and immediately get stuck sorting files into a system that makes absolutely no sense. When I tell a coworker the system is broken, she tells me I'm just the most stupid person to have ever existed and to keep filing to make up for it. I feel like I could die there, endlessly sorting files that no one cares about into a system that was made by the devil. I ask my spy if we're dead. He says no, but we found a lead. I grab a coworkers keys and run for the garage like my life depended on it and we leave the office behind in a truck. It's night and we pull into the parking lot of a diner. For some reason we have guns. We cut the lights to the diner and start searching with flashlights for my sister. Three hooligans appear in the back, but I can't make out their faces. Two of them look like the snowboarders who blasted music and rode through the cave by the body. I question them and the third escapes through a window. I give chase. We're running through a field of flowers and the moon was bright enough to make out the colors of each flower. I know the person I'm chasing is my sister. I wonder why I'm chasing her and we're on different sides of a mysterious battle. She stops running and I cut two flowers for her. I hand them to her and tell her I love her and I'll be the one to ski and recover the body. She seems sad but hands me a bulletproof vest to wear and warns me of the scientists. My hot spy agrees with her and they both tell me not to go, but I have to see this through and they respect that. I drive alone to my old college town to meet a friend at a hockey game. I don't see him in the crowd, so I sit alone and watch the game. Eventually the game ends and everyone filters out until I see my friend across the ice and it's just the two of us. We put on skates and skate around and he tells me about the scientists and how their own people went awol and killed their own agents. He tells me that there is no rival group because it's the same group. I'm disturbed again because I don't know why I'm involved. We skate for awhile longer and it's fun. I drive the truck back to the scientists lodge and my brother is there and tells me there's something I need to see. We walk in and are greeted by a horrible slimy corn monster! It starts speaking and I finally realize that it's the man that had sat next to me at dinner who couldn't stop eating corn. The corn man tells me that the scientists turned him into a corn monster and the same will happen to me eventually. He said the members who turned against their own group did so because they didn't agree with turning people into corn monsters. The dead body I found was one of the top scientists who filled his body with antibodies and could save all the corn people. But the evil scientists didn't like that so they had him killed. They wanted to kill anyone who had the ski skills to reach the body. I start to panic because I do not want to be a corn monster. I practically throw on my skis and make my way to the mountain. The hot spy says he'll love me even if I turn into a corn monster and I tell him he's insane. He agrees and I appreciate him for it. I tell him it won't work between us, but if he ever does some cool spy adventures to count me in. He drives off in the truck. I make my way to the lift and I can already feel my body turning into corn. I'm thankful for the bullet proof vest keeping my corn in. I'm on the lift and start to freeze because I forgot to wear a coat....and then I woke up."

Finally I grabbed a hose and turned it on with hot water and aimed it at the mound of cats. When the water hit them they jumped back and my poor brutalized cat crawled in agony to me.

Went to restroom and looked closer at it and realized it wasn't a coin but rather a medallion.  It was in three pieces, attached to each other. I slide them apart and saw one had nothing but a blank.

In the dream I was talking about Cato the Elder and his famous ""Cartago Delendo Est"" speeches, and even in the dream I had the quote right.

I first got my two small bags. When i got my large bag, the ghost didn't struggle with me so I asked why. He said that it's because we have to make it past the palm tree, 500 m from the house.
