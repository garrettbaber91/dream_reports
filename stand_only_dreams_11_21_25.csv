2,"I had a dream a few nights ago. I was walking around campus with this one guy I like, just chilling, holding hands (I could feel that). We walked past murphy, then over to ISB to hang out with some of my friends. I remember at one point I got ahead of him and just stood there, arm stretched out back to him to get him to rush forward and catch up. Once we were with friends we just sat and hung out, we were also dating in the dream. Lowk it was a fun dream. Emotions represented v well, top tier yearning."
6,"I was dreaming about where I was a little kid driving to where my parents work. Along that dream, we did very random things such as drive a monster truck that was red, looked at animals but wasn't at the zoo, overall felt like I had no control just because that I was a kid and whatever my parents say went. I felt the emotions of confused but joyous throughout. There wasn't really a plot that I remembered."
7,"It was in third person and me and my friends were in a dungeon. It was dark and water dripped from the ceiling. Moss covered the walls and bars we could hear the wails of others around us. I could see the shadow of my best friend in front of my cell. Her face illuminated by candle light set at intervals along the hall connecting each cell. The head of this evil organization appeared and told us that if someone ate poison the rest would live and be set free. So i decided to eat it. However, he lied and no one was allowed freed. This made us so angry I magically recovered and I broke through the bars of my cell in the middle of the night and set everyone free then set the dungeon on fire. We all ran through the forest away from the flaming building our path illuminated by moonlight."
8,"Me and my two roommates were in an apartment building and the guys living a couple doors down some how broke into our apartment. They only left a note. Then they kept doing it, then I woke up."
10,"My dream was about my roommate. She got up and went to sleep in the living room, and took our nightstand with her. The environment was our dorm room, and I felt stressed out because I didn't know why she was mad at me or if she was mad at me. It was first-person point of view, and it stayed the same over the course of the dream."
12,"I had a dream that I was at camp with my friends, and we were participating in the typical camp activities. It was a very happy and nice dream. I felt happy and nostalgic, it was from my pov and it was very close and personal as if I was there."
13,going to a concert and then being left behind it wasnt detailed and blurry
17,"I remember a desolate wasteland, I could feel heat, and smell smoke, I saw shadows darting around but could not make out any physical characteristics just walking shadows darting past me. I felt anger, just intense rage."
23,A dinosaur picked up my families minivan with my entire family inside and started breaking it. It was dark and stormy outside and we were in an abandoned trailer park. It was third person point of view. I was very scared and crying.
26,I had this dream about that I had slept through my class and I failed it and my parents got really mad at me.
28,"I have a vivid dream every couple of weeks about tornadoes, specifically about hiding from them. The most recent took place in a school where every wall had a window so there was no where to really hide. Me and a group of other girls had to find our way to the gym, the only place in the school with no windows. The problem was that we had to go through a big door, then a tiny hole in the wall to get in. We barely made it because we kept having to stop and drop for cover because there were at least three tornadoes. In the dream I was very anxious that I wouldn't make it into the gym in time. I was also stressed because no one was taking the tornado seriously, and I was the only one hiding, everyone else was just going on as if it were a pointless drill. The interesting part about these dreams is that I'm from Colorado, where we never have tornadoes."
29,"It was a nightmare that I was being kidnapped, I remember looking into the mirror of a run down bathroom and my face being especially my eye being black and blue. I ran out side of the building and remember the feeling of like wind on my face but always feeling like someone was behind me. The dream repeated twice until I was hidden on an airplane and then guy who was trying to find me ended up falling out of the airplane and I woke up."
34,"First person POV, on a date with the person I like. I felt really happy. I could hear just normal background noises as if it was real life."
35,"I had a dream recently that stuck with me. It started with me sitting in a classroom, waiting for my grade on a big exam. When the paper came back, 'F' was written across the top in red. My chest sank, and it felt like everyone else in the room knew I had failed too, even though no one said anything.
The scene shifted, and suddenly I was walking outside, but the world felt heavier than usual. It was cloudy and damp, like it had just rained. My shoes splashed in puddles as I walked, but I didn‚Äôt have anywhere to go. In the dream, failing that class meant I had dropped out completely, and I knew I hadn‚Äôt passed my OAT either to get into Optometry school.

Eventually I ended up sitting on a curb in the city. Cars and people moved around me, but it was like I wasn‚Äôt really there, no one noticed me. I felt empty, like I had lost everything I had worked for. The whole dream stayed in first person, so it really felt like I was living through it.

The strongest part wasn‚Äôt the images but the feelings: shame, fear, and a sense of being stuck with no way forward. When I woke up, I still carried that heavy, unsettled feeling for a while."
37,"My dream was in first person view. My two friends and I were at a house but there was a smaller house across the woods where we had to keep our clothes. I remember we walked through the woods and went to the smaller house so we could get our clothes, but when we got there we realized something was wrong with the house. We felt unsettled and I woke up before I could find out what was wrong."
40,"I had a dream where I was with my friends playing pickleball. I remember it in first person, as if I was really standing on the court holding the paddle in my hand. The court was outside, and the ground was a faded green with white lines that almost glowed under the bright afternoon sun. I could feel the paddle‚Äôs rough grip against my palm and hear the sharp pop each time the plastic ball hit it.

My friends were laughing and cheering, and their voices echoed in the open air. The smell of freshly cut grass carried on a light breeze, mixing with the faint rubbery scent of the pickleball itself. I could see my best friend across the net, smiling as they served the ball with a quick flick of their wrist. The yellow ball spun in the air, and I felt a rush of energy as I stepped forward to return it.

The dream felt light and fun‚Äîalmost like time slowed down so we could enjoy it longer. Even though it was competitive, there was no stress, only excitement. I felt connected to my friends, as if we were all on the same team even though we were playing against each other. The emotions were a mix of joy, focus, and pure enjoyment.

When I woke up, I realized that the dream showed me how much I value spending time with my friends and how sports bring us closer together."
43,I forgot to turn in an assignment and nothing was letting me submit so I felt really stressed out and anxious.
45,"I got into a car accident years ago with an ex-boyfriend and got PTSD from it. In the dream, I am riding in a car with my sister, her boyfriend, and that ex-boyfriend, and we are driving around my grandparents' lake house (windy roads surrounded by trees). We are having a good time. I cannot remember what happened next, but suddenly we are in the water with the car, but not sinking, and I can see the car I wrecked also in the water, but further away, and also not sinking. This is a recurring dream."
46,A recent dream I had is a dream about me and friend getting in an argument and people from my family showed up.
47,"The point of view is first person. I was from a different planet that was purple and orange. This planet was dying, being attacked by giant grub worms, and going into a black hole. I had a twin brother (13 years old), who had brown hair. We had a dog. Both me and my twin brother had the ability to fly, turn invisible, and fire powers. Our parents wanted to save us from our dying planet so they sent us to live with our grandparents on Earth. We were very sad about leaving our parents, but knew it was the best for our safety. We were sent via spaceship and landed on a playground on Earth that our grandparents live close to. None of the kids on the playground reacted when our spaceship landed on their play set. Our grandparents arrived at the park to pick us up and warned us that the Grinch lives on Earth and that his only mission is to find us and kill us. So our job is to blend in with all the other kids and pretend to be normal. However, at school one day, a group of kids see me and my brother turn invisible. So we have to tell them our backstory and they agree to help protect us from the Grinch. On the last day of school, it is dark and stormy. Me and my brother are the only two kids in this specific classroom. We hear a creepy laugh coming from outside of the classroom door and it opens. The Grinch, with a Christmas hat, stands in the door way and says, ""I'm gonna get you!"" The end. I was very scared at the end of this dream. I woke up at the very end out of fear. However, it was a very enjoyable and long dream to be a part of."
48,"First person dream of spotted lanternflies, an invasive bug, invading Lawrence. Except some of them were cybernetic and gigantic. Then for some reason they had a form of cordyceps and so we all hunkered down in the pretzel factory on the edge of town. Then my dream got interrupted and I was remembering details about protocols for my bacterial genetics class, unrelated. I remember being scared of what the bugs would do to the landscape but I had a flamethrower so it wasn't too bad and was more amusing than anything else. It was sort of the vibe of Fallout New Vegas or The Day After or Starship Troopers. I'm infamous for not being scared of bugs so it was more so about how destructive they were to the city."
49,"I was kidnapped, i remember looking at myself in the mirror almost black and blue like i had been beaten up. I kept running away but then it was like i would wake up and be back in that bathroom looking at myself again black and blue. It went like that until i ran away for the third time and then i somehow ended up on a plane and the guy who was chasing me fell out of the plane. I woke up finally but I felt like I was falling."
52,"I was on a sidewalk, winding down a steep hill lined with trees. I was laying on the ground with my comforter from my bed wrapped around me, trying to nap. Eventually I was unsuccessful and got up, walking back up the hill with my comforter in hand. A man approached me and grabbed the comforter from my arms. I cared lots about it, so I grabbed it back and pulled at it against him. I tried to scream for help but was unable. My voice hurt and I struggled to communicate anything. I was stressed, upset, and speechless. I woke up immediately after being unable to scream and was anxious."
54,"I had a dream someone I used to be really close to was trying to connect and catch up late at night during a camping trip. The people in my life currently who I'm close to were also in my dream and it was a continuous back and forth of seeing the old friendships/relationships and the new friendships/relationships. It was first person, and everyone looked exactly how they would in reality. I felt sad, but happy to see some of them. I felt like I missed them."
55,"In this dream I start off in my old house in nebraska and then me and my uncle go outside and there is a woodsy area and out comes a wolf, wolves are now chasing us back to my house, we end up going into the house and close the door. By the garage door there is my pantry and my uncle starts getting a snack out of the pantry and while he is doing that the wolves broke through and start eating me while my uncle eats snacks in the pantry. This is in 3rd person I belive and I was really scared."
56,I had a dream I was watching this baby that was the cutest baby I have ever seen. It wasn't mine but when I went to take a picture of the baby it turned into a toddler through the camera lens. It was weird but I do remember how cute it was.
58,The last dream that I can recall was just the other night I for some reason was laying with my boyfriends best friend rather than my boyfriend and the best friend started trying to do stuff with me so I got up really fast and laid with my boyfriend because I obviously didn't want someone else touching me and I was  really apologetic to my boyfriend because what the heck was I doing laying with his best friend. I would never do that in real life so it was a really weird feeling of guilt that didn't really happen.
59,"I had a dream that my roommate was in an insane asylum and her mom put her in there. We all went and visited her. It was dark and had one open room almost like a library. The rest of my roommates were with us. It was in first person. I felt happy seeing her, but sad that she was in there. I was mad at her mom for putting her in there."
60,I was walking home from the bars with a group of friends and then a van cornered us so we ran in other direction but car blocked that too and they took us in the van and had us work and give us a drug so nobody remembered where we came from besides me and they worked as mindless robots but I got out
61,"I was in my backyard setting up for a wedding. It was a warm and sunny day. I saw my mom, sister, and celebrity Chris Briney. I was in first person view. As I was setting up for the wedding Chris was upset because it was his wedding and nerves were getting to him. I told my mom about what I saw and she stopped the wedding. I felt nervous and anxious about the wedding."
68,"My dream was that I was having a sleepover at my boyfriend's house. I was very excited because we do long-distance, but all of his college friends were over, which I did not know about, and caused me to get angry. I was lying in his bed waiting for him to come into the room so we could go to sleep, but instead, he kept hanging out with his friends and ignoring that I was there. They were all playing video games in the living room while I was on my phone. My point of view was first person the entire time. Feeling ignored caused me to become very sad, upset, and annoyed. Eventually he came into his room and asked why I was upset and I said ""you act like im not even hear, you are always going to prioritize them""."
78,"I had a dream the frontal halves of my two front teeth fell out and revealed a bunch of pores within my teeth. I don't remember the setting I was in, but I do remember I was doing something normal when my teeth fell out all of a sudden. It felt extremely weird, even worse when I saw the state of my teeth. I started stressing and freaking out because I take pride in my teeth and oral health in general and my teeth just fell out. I wouldn't say I have trypophobia, but in this dream I did. I remember I could feel the pores within my teeth too, and I hated the feeling. I was squirming and trying to figure out how to fix my teeth. Then I woke up and felt weird."
84,"In my dream it was first-person point of view and I was on KU campus on the small parking lot outside of the north Stouffer dorm building. It was a sunny day that had spring vibes because the weather felt fresh not hot and the grass around the lot was fresh and green and it felt great in the dream I thought it was a nice day out. I was walking to my car a navy-blue BMW sedan that was parked 3 cars away on the furthest left column while holding an envelope, thinking about the tag I needed to put on my car. My mom was standing next to my car when I got there towards the license plate she had her curly hair in the bun with a neutral expression and was wearing a gray t-shirt, black shorts, and her black heydudes. Once I got there I talked and joked with my mom while opening the envelope, the words were more like how the adults in peanuts sound but I was very happy to see her and talk with her. In the envelope was my car tag sticker for the year on a white sticker sheet, it was bright orange with random letters as the date my mom helped me put the sticker over the expired one that said September 30 2025. Once the task was completed I felt relieved and the dream ended by my view dissolving into black and me waking up still feeling the same way."
91,It was in first person and it was my birthday. I woke up and went down stairs and my mom told me happy birthday. I went on my phone to see if I had gotten any messages from my friends or family but there was none. Turns out that everyone forgot my birthday and i woke up feeling sad.
93,My college roommate and I went shopping at a thrift store.
96,"What happened was, i was in my house that i currently live in on campus and i was walking up to my door when this deranged man approached me really fast. I remember being really uneasy about it and like i was running out of time to open the door. This was all in first person but then kind of switched to third person. It was a sunny day and the trees were swaying. So anyways, I was on my porch about to open the door when he showed up and then he started asking me a bunch of questions to which i cant remember but i do rememeber looking directly at his face and noticing that his pupils were super dialated and that he was probably on something. And thats when i started feeling even more uneasy. all of a sudden this little girl and boy appear next to him asking if i needed help in a non discreet way and so i whispered to them to call 911 and they did but the man saw what i was trying to tell them i guess and then he attacked me. I have never been more scared in my life then at that point in the dream. He managed to tackle me through the front door and basically harassed me and some other stuff that i dont want to talk about. The cops finally arrived and my family was there some how and so i started to feel less uneasy but then they barely did anything to help me and then i woke up."
97,The latest dream that I experienced was my boyfriend cheating on me. I don't remember exactly what it was like; I just remember feeling very upset and hurt. I had a pit in my stomach and felt almost nauseous.
102,"There was a massive spider in my shower and it was as big as me when i got close to it but when i stepped back it was regular size. I was trying to kill it but it wouldn't go away, and eventually when i tried to kill it when it was small it lunged at me and i ended up waking up and jumping back because it was so vivid i thought it did lunge at me."
107,"I was with my boyfriend, and we were in a room just making TikToks. I remember one we made where I pressed the button to start the video, and we went far back and showed our outfits. I showed my first, and then he showed his, and then we hugged at the end. The video only lasted a couple of seconds, but it was very fun. were just enjoying each other's company, and I felt so happy."
108,"I had a dream that took place on the beach with my ex boyfriends mom. We were celebrating something because there was party decor everywhere, but I am not sure what. My mom was there too and was in the kitchen working on the food. All my brothers were there playing football too. We were talking and all catching up until a big storm hit the house. There was lots of commotion, and then we all disappeared."
110,"I recently had a horrible dream where I experienced sleep paralysis. In this, I could not move at all or scream or yell no matter how hard I tried to, the only thing I could do was look around my room. The room was pretty much pitch black with the only light being the dim moonlight shining through the window directly to my left. My room is a square layout with 4 walls, and when you walk in through the door, my bed in the top right corner, my dressers and guitars are in the top left corner, and then my closet, tv and night stand are on the middle of the wall where the door is when you walk in. I was on my bed in the top right corner, laying there paralyzed, and trying to scream as I felt the most intense fear I have ever felt in my life. It was an extremely surreal yet confusing feeling, and there was a very tall shadow figure standing right in front of me on the bottom right corner of the room. The shadow figure had no distinct facial features or anything, just a 9 foot tall shadow standing there and staring at me. After about 2 minutes of this which felt like forever, I suddenly regained my sense of movement and woke up in an absolute panic."
111,"I had a dream that I was working for a Christian organization that was analyzing how people functioned in society based off of what brought them the most purpose in life. These religious researchers had concluded that everyone felt the need to have some other life form rely on them for life. Some of the things people chose to place their value in taking care of were: children, plants, animals, society. I felt confused by this information. I was taken through houses that represented how the different lifestyles of people lived. In this dream I was touring the buildings with a middle-aged, white bald man that I know from my workplace, and my friend's brother who I supposedly was dating. During the dream I felt like the researchers were crazy and I was judging them."
112,I had a dream about a man breaking into my house
113,A man broke into my house and tried to kill me
115,"I was sitting in a diner. I was in a booth with bright red plastic benches. In front of me was a guy from my work whom I also had a crush on. We were having a conversation when all of a sudden he got up and walked through the double doors to the kitchen. I remember being able to see his head through the circular windows walking away. I was waiting, but he never came back. Eventually, a group walked in, and 2 guys sat in front of me, taking up the space the original guy was in. The diner was full, and it was no other seats. One of them was studying from his religious studies class and ended up asking me for help. I remember feeling better around this guy than the original guy. Then I woke up."
117,"The last dream I remember was about a close friend from my home town. It was kind of a weird dream... Basically, I was going to the bathroom in a public restroom and I remember looking through the crack of the stall and seeing my good friend. I remember feeling very excited when she noticed me as well, but for some reason we could not speak to each other. She waved at me and I smiled. I think during the dream I thought it was rush week, and this friend is a year older then me, therefore she was already in a sorority and could not talk to me because of ""dirty rushing""."
118,"I am at home, but my house is in the forest surrounded by deer and a river. The deer are drinking water from the river, and there are a lot of flowers around that I could smell in the dream. I feel calm and happy during this dream. There are also butterflies on every single flower that surrounds the river. All I do in this dream is just sit on the porch and watch the deer and take in the view. It is a perfect day and it is very sunny. I am the only one in the dream, and I am seeing this like I am actually in the forest. I feel very happy and not stressed in this dream."
124,"It was a dream about how I captured a cockroach and give it a piece of fish to see if it would grow. It ended up growing too much and I had to put it into a Tupperware container, and it expanded and eventually exploded out a bunch of maggots all over the yard. I had to end up trying to avoid them and trying to get rid of them. Then I woke up. It was pretty scary and intense."
125,"Going to a football game with my girlfriend, not being allowed in, it smelled like popcorn and burgers, then going home and watching movies."
129,"First-person dream following my own perspective. I was coming home to a party at my boyfriend's (Sebastian) apartment. Three friends were already there, and Sebastian was not there yet. The three friends, Kennedy, Vicki, and Hannah, helped me pick out an outfit for the party, and it was a navy midi dress with ruffles. We all got ready together, doing our make-up, hair, and other pre-party activities, such as sipping a glass of white wine. Sebastian arrived home from work, wearing his police uniform. We went into the bedroom, and my friends left to decorate the apartment. In the bedroom, he got ready for the party, and we had some alone time before a lot of people came. When we were both ready, we walked out of his bedroom, and the apartment was beautifully decorated, and there was fancy sushi on the table for everyone to snack on. But the sushi was abnormally large. We played lavish games and drank prosecco, and I remember a lot of laughter and just a content and joyful feeling. And I woke up after that."
140,I had a cool dream where I was walking on a hiking trail with my family and it was like a nice rainy day.  As we were walking we say a few deer and and watched them and it was super cool adn we were all excited and happy.  Then soon after I woke up.
141,"I had a dream that I was at my neighbor's house across the street, and they had like 100 TVs all over their living room to watch football. There were at least 6 people there, and all were in football attire. I was viewing the dream in first person and sitting on the floor of their living room for a few hours."
144,"I was showering in the bathroom of my childhood bedroom, I thought I saw something but brushed it off and stepped out of the shower. I then looked back inside of the shower and saw a man holding onto my shower head with his chest against the wall looking back at me. He stepped out of the shower and I was just standing there screaming help me over and over again while he laughed at me and just stared at me (he was then facing me). I than was downstairs in my dads office yelling at my father because he did not come and help me when I was yelling. I felt hopeless and mad. The man than walked down the stairs by my dads office and was tip toeing (even though it was the middle of the day and we could see him) and than I just got really confused."
145,"I recently had a vivid and unsettling dream. At first, everything felt normal and cheerful. I am working on a biology assignment that required me to find a remote location in the forest. The place was described in a photo, a cave entrance marked by two bear statues. All I had to do was take a picture there as proof.

When I arrived, the atmosphere suddenly became gloomy and heavy. I found the cave and took a quick photo, but then I noticed a group of suspicious people inside. Instead of leaving, I felt a strange pull to step closer and see what was happening. To my horror, I realized they were part of a human trafficking group. My heart pounded, and fear rushed through me. I tried to quietly back away, but they saw me.

I ran as fast as I could, jumped into a passing vehicle, and called the police. I remember feeling a mix of panic and determination. The dream ended vaguely, but I think the authorities caught them. When I woke up, I still felt uneasy, it was both realistic and terrifying."
147,"I had a dream I was sitting in a cottage looking house in a kitchen with baby blue walls and an island table with the actors from the Gilmore Girls, and we were sitting around the table, and I was trying to explain to them why I didn't like the show. I was in first person the whole time; it seemed very real. In the dream, I was trying to tell them why I didn't like the show without offending the actors because, for some reason, I felt like they were both the actors and characters from the show, and I felt really bad because I didn't want to hurt their feelings."
148,It was a first person point of view and what happened is I was with a group of my friends and this guy that I am friends with in real life was in it but the thing is there was heavy flirtation between him and I and the interesting thing is that in real life I have heard from others friends that he may have feelings for me but basically we were at a kitchen counter and he came up behind me and gave me an intimate hug and we just looked at each other and then I woke up. I felt flustered but happy overall
159,"I had a dream I was kidnapped, and lots of other people were too it was in a weird house with this super closed off stair case and a banister on the second floor where you could see outside on the street and neighborhood. One person I remember was a middle-aged blonde woman and some other people of all ethnicity and ages. I established a relationship with the kidnapper and sort of fell in love with him. I didn't feel scared at all until the people found a way out of the house, and he snapped and jumped through the window and landed face down on the street I thought he was dead I ran outside to see, and then he stood up and had a gun my heart dropped I was scared I tried to run but my legs wouldn't move. I woke up"
160,Last night I had a dream I was with my hometown friends in a familiar place but I can't remember why it's familiar. I felt happy and relieved that we were all together again. I can't remeber what we were doing but I remember everyone laughing and talking about plans we had coming up.
161,"I was with all 4 of my friends, and we were driving on this dirt road with no lights, when all of a sudden, people started following us. I was extremely scared and was worried something would happen to me or my friends, and there was nothing I could do about it. It was in 3rd person, it was like I was seeing it from a bird's eye view."
165,"It was a nice somewhat sunny day outside and I was about to head to my college class when I somehow got information about my dad passing and in the moment I remember being upset and maybe even shedding a tear but I kept on my day. I knew I had to just make it through my one class I had and then when I got home I could break down and cry. Next thing I know I‚Äôm in my classroom and still thinking about how my dad had passed but then the class is over and everyone had left except for one girl who seemed hesitant to come up to me. I was still sitting down and then I was confused on why this girl who looked Hispanic with pin straight long black hair was walking up to me. She just came up to me and asked ‚ÄúCan I pray for you?‚Äù I was so confused and saddened because she had no idea who I was and had no idea my dad had passed. I didn‚Äôt think I gave off any indication that I was upset or look than I normally had in that class. Immediately after she asked me if she could pray for me I shook my head yeah and began to cry so hard, bawl even. I could feel how strong the emotion was that my head began to hurt a little. I remember thinking that it was crazy how this random girl had the urge to come pray for me specifically even though we didn‚Äôt know each other at all. I ended up waking up and had realized I actually had been bawling my eyes out and my nose even began to run. I of course in the dream was upset that my dad had passed away but it was really the fact of how I felt it was God showing me he was there for me at that time, even though my dad hadn‚Äôt passed away in reality. Like I had realized God worked through someone else to get to me or show he‚Äôs there for me in hard times. I feel like the reason why I started crying was because I felt reassurance from God that everything was going to be alright. Most of the dream happened in first person but whenever I teared up in the beginning of the dream it was a quick third person view so I could see myself but then I went back to first person. Later when the random girl put her hand on my head it went back the third person for a brief second."
171,I was in a school area as if I were at campus but it wasn't necessarily this specific campus. I was just walking around and then I went to go hang out with a friend. In my point of view everything happened as if I was there when it happened. I didn't really feel anything.
179,I really wanted a sign from my grandmother who passed away a year ago. She came to me in my dream. I was really nervous about a speech I was presenting to my class and then I had a dream about. In my dream I'm about to present and I forget everything I'm supposed to say. Then I see my grandma in the audience and suddenly remember everything. I'm really glad I got a sign from her and it felt good to know that she is still here for me even though she's in heaven now.
190,My dream was that my boyfriend was talking to other girls more than me and was ignoring me to talk to them. It made me very frustrated at him in my dream and I woke up for 1 second and was mad but he was actually just sleeping next to me and I realized that it wasn‚Äôt real. I just remember being so mad
195,"I was in a scene of the movie Coraline. We were in the house and the items came alive, and a cat was biting my hand. it was in first person. I felt happy and excited."
206,"I was in my room. The environment was quite tense and slightly uneasy because of a girl I was with. I thought we were just friends, but looking back, it's difficult to define our relationship. Regardless of our relationship title, we both loved and cared for each other. Her and I felt comfortable around each other. But we were arguing. Nothing crazy; speaking quietly and not yelling, though I was growing frustrated, annoyed, and anxious. I could feel my heart burning in my throat. I felt myself growing emotionally angry as I was passionate about whatever matter we were talking about. I was sitting at the foot of my bed and she was laying horizontally on the bed, as one typically does. Her laying down also made me more upset because I felt dismissed. Almost as if what I was saying was not important to her at all. That also increased my frustration. And she kept trying to calm me down because she could see my frustration growing. Then, mid tangent/rant/etc., she kissed me in my mouth. It was almost like an apology. Understandably, she felt bad. But after that, it wasn't just a kiss, it turned into a full makeout session. I remember being initially uncomfortable and afraid if someone was to walk into this one bedroom studio apartment; afraid someone was looking through the two windows that lined the corners of my room. Unbearably afraid and ashamed. I don't like women/girls in that way. I am sexually attracted to men. I couldn't help but be ashamed of myself. In my mind, I thought about how I was letting my family down by partaking in this, though I didn't even initiate it. I remember initially, after the first kiss, I was shocked. But after that initial shock, I closed my eyes and pressed in. It was something that in my head I knew was wrong, but in my heart it felt so good. So we continued. My heart rate was intensifying. I could feel myself yearning, almost like this was a part of myself I had silenced for so long that was awaiting to be freed and released. I was overindulgent. I lost it and I went crazy. Things escalated rather rapidly and we were about to do the deed. It was at that point that I had a moment of realization. I took a step back and thought about the fact that I don't like girls. The fact that I have a boyfriend. The fact that I've never had sex, let alone with a woman. I recognized I didn't know how to, and it hurt me to know that somewhere within me, that's what I wanted. I remember after that moment and during that moment, I felt fulfilled. Bonded to this girl, connected even. I felt free almost. Though that made no sense, as I felt so secretive and sneaky. Like I had to hide this. This confused me; how could something truly be freeing if I felt like I had to hide it from everything and everyone. I was confused. My feelings were array. Then, I woke up, still feeling aroused, yet so ashamed."
210,"First person. It was in a sort of mini auditorium (fold down, blue fabric classroom type chairs) in the corner of a building entrance with a lot of rooms next to it. Very bright and airy. I was in one of the adjoining rooms, which was empty but beige and classroom-like with the block walls and stubbly ceiling but there were windows facing the entrance/auditorium area, and I was on a phone interview. The interviewer sounded pretty bored and flat when asking me the questions, so I thought I was doing a bad job, however at the very end she (in the same tone) told me I was pretty much guaranteed the job. I don't remember what type of job it was, but I think it had something to do with being an assistant in some sort of medical practice. I ended the phone call happily, but for some reason decided to call back and ask questions. A different lady answered, and she sounded much more hostile. When I asked her questions about the job, she told me that she didn't know what I was talking about however referenced my application many times and told me it was awful and she didn't know why I was assuming that I had gotten the job when it wasn't official yet. I eventually hung up and felt really upset, but went to the auditorium area to try and calm down and find something to do. I saw my best friend there, but she didn't acknowledge me very much when I approached. Something happened in between but I forgot. Some sort of presentation begins to happen on stage, and when I approach my friend again to sit down next to her she claims, in a very standoffish tone, that all the chairs in her row are saved for other people, even though only about half of them were filled up. I'm obviously hurt by this but trying not to act like it, so I just decided to leave and not watch the presentation. As I'm leaving, she comes up to me to ask if I was upset, to which I responded that I was fine. She doesn't believe me, and told me that we could hang out after the presentation, but I felt hurt and didn't really want to, even though I said that we could hang out afterwards. As I walk further into the entrance room (away from the stage), the woman on stage starts to speak very oddly and almost cult-like about things that she hates. I realize after listening for a bit that it's the same lady that I spoke with on the phone the second time. She looked like a regular middle aged woman, but the way she moved and spoke felt oddly unhinged and threatening. She would say that she hated something, and then all of the crowd in the chairs would repeat after her that ""we"" hate that thing. It was a lot of random things, like dogs or chairs(? for some reason). Eventually, during this routine that I'm watching in sort of fascination, she looks directly at me and points, chanting the same ""we hate"" speech with my full name. The crowd turns to look at me and does the same thing. It's a small crowd and none of them came towards me, but I felt physically threatened and scared by this. It all felt very cult-ish. I don't remember what happened afterwards, but I think I woke up soon after."
213,"I was sitting on the edge of a cliff looking down on a town that was big but looked little. I had a massive pencil or stick and I would draw the town into creation. Every time I would make something and no matter what I tried to make it would come out a different color or slightly different shape than I wanted it too. I kept drawing just to draw something how I imagined it and when I looked up I was in my dorm room, then I woke up"
215,After my grandfather died i had a dream that someone in my family died and i woke up at 4:55am. Had the same exact dream the next night and woke up at 4:55am.
219,It was a nightmare that i have sometimes that changes ever so slightly. I wake up in my room with a snake in my bed and when it comes close to me it explodes into thousands of spiders then i will wake up.
220,I was in a color war between all the different colors and people were attacking others with pool noodles of their color. then at the end of the war there was this giant old house that was like a haunted house. we had to go through it and it was falling apart and there were also giant pink portals that we couldn't fall into. then we played hide and seek with a giant one eyed monster. there was the timer from my jiu-jitsu gym that counted down from 5 minutes which was how long we had to survive the hide and seek. there was a black and while dalmation that almost gave me away but he didnt. then at the end my uncle and aunt and cousin were there to celebrate us surviving with a delicious vanilla cake.
221,"It was all first person. It was hard to distinguish that it was a dream due to that factor. It took place in my dorm and on campus. All the locations were accurate to how they are in real life. My dorm had my desk with funko pops, my computer, and lego flower as well as all my posters on the wall. All the campus buildings involved seemed normal, the primary one was Wescoe hall. The dream was simple, but uncomfortable. I checked my canvas account and realized I had been enrolled in an art class: an art class I had never attended because I didn't realize that I was enrolled in it. I started to panic in my room trying to remember how I got enrolled in this class and if I had actually been taking it. Fear set in as if I had missed every class for a half of a semester, then I would definitely face repercussions. I changed in a hurry in my dorm, the world spinning around me, and then ran to Wescoe. That is where the dream ended. It was very realistic and felt like a boarder between dream and reality. I woke up thinking I took an art class."
222,"I had a dream the other night where I was at my boyfriend's house late at night and we were watching some TV show. I got a call that my mom had gotten into a terrible accident and that they didn't know if she was going to make it. I remember not being able to breathe and falling to the floor. Then the dream kind of skipped forward to me living life normally then randomly having trouble breathing thinking about my mom, but at that point no one seemed to understand or care. It was a terrible dream and I felt like my world was falling apart, I remember waking up sweating. I only remember parts and how it didn't all really make sense, but it was bad. It was in first-person the whole time."
225,It was frazy I thought i was on a trip
227,"I was in a dorm, and we had turned two lofted beds into one by pushing them together. My friend and I woke up in the dream, and their roommate had come home early and found their room completely rearranged. Their bed was NOW ATTACHED TO my friend's, and they were very confused."
228,"I only remember a small part of my dream, but I was eating dinner with my ex boyfriend at a restaurant that looked familiar; however, I could not remember the name of it when I woke up. It was a very short dream of us talking at dinner at a two person table."
229,"I was at the Emporia Zoo with my boyfriend, he's tall, brunette, and has blue eyes, and he was wearing a black shirt and shorts. I was wearing a yellow sweater and jean shorts with my hair curled, and he proposed to me at the zoo and we automatically got married there. However, another couple got married at the same exact time as us and my whole family was around and then it ended. I was very happy in my dream, but felt a little weirded out since another couple was getting married right next to us."
235,"In my recent memorable dream, my mom had a newborn baby which was very weird because my dad cant have kids anymore. My parents last kid is 9 years old, so my mom was spending a lot of time focusing on this baby and not her other kids since they were all old enough to take care of themselves. She was telling me how she felt bad for Evie (the 9 year old). She let me see the baby for a little and during that one of our friends Marcy came over and hung out with us. I was very confused by the dream because my parents cant have kids together."
236,I keep having dreams of my Ex boyfriend. We broke up 5 months ago. I had a dream that was first person and we were on some vacation. I remember feeling super upset and sad. I walked into a room and he was with a random girl from my high school cheating on me.
242,"A few nights ago, I dreamed of me living in Chicago standing on a rooftop overlooking the city. The air was cold, and I could smell the rain and the food trucks down on the streets. I could hear the hum of cars and trains echoing through the streets. Suddenly, the sky turned a deep shade of pink, and snow began to fall even though it was the middle of summer. I streched my hand out to catch a snowflake, for a moment the city began to glow and I felt this powerful mix of loneliness and hope.  Like the world was huge, but somehow still meant for me."
243,I was swimming constantly at a swim meet and couldn't make myself stop.
246,"Me and my old debate coach who sexually harassed me were alone in my old debate room. It was set up the exact same way I remember it. It was a long room with no windows, and two long tables horizontal in the back, that contrasted the rows of desks. I can't recall where we were in the room, but he was rapeing me."
255,"I was swimming off a tropical beach with my mother. My mother has medium length blonde hair, and I myself have short, strawberry blonde hair. We were swimming across the water to an island on the other side. We were halfway across the water when a large, great white shark came. It taunted and watched us. We tried swimming faster but then it grabbed my mother by the hand and next thing I knew she was gone. I don't know where it took her, but next thing I remember I was swimming back. I was underwater the whole time and swimming extremely fast for a human, almost in a beaver-like manner. About halfway to the beach, their shark came back. I played dead and buried myself in the sand a bit at the bottom of the water. I remember the shark said something to itself but I don't quite remember what. Almost like he forgot something that he needed in order to eat me at the other end of the water. Nonetheless, he turned around and left me to go get that thing. I then began swimming in that very fast, beaver-like manner, until I was almost back to a dock on the beach when I noticed the shark behind me again. He was swimming very fast and ferocious, but I somehow reached the dock before he got to me. I looked at him and his fin swimming around the dock, like he was waiting for me to come back in. I then left and walked up to a wooden hut/beach house behind the beach. I remember feeling very worried and stressed throughout the whole dream. I was confused and what he had done and where he had taken my mother. I remember there were more people at the hut once I left, but I don't remember who or what happened after that."
257,I dreamt that my professor told me where my class was and it was in the wrong building and I couldn't where it actually was located and I set my alarm for 5 am to find this class and when I got there everyone there made fun of me because in the class that I was missing trying to locate was watching on the screen a video surveillance of me going to the place he told me it was and it was humiliating and I woke up feeling really embarrassed and intimidated by my peers.
259,I had a dream about my friend and losing them in a crowd. It was loud and hard to breathe.
260,"I don't really remember much of it but it was a series of unorganized events, like I kept doing activities that kept switching. And eventually I was in a car with my friends and we were driving, and for some reason we were angry. In the midst of that, it started snowing and we drifted off the road and died."
263,I was in the Arizona country side living on a ranch. My family and I were famous for horse racing and would care for horses. So I was training with my sister on the race track with our best horse. I road the horse three times around and stopped to let my sister on. The moment I let her on the horse it became angry and started jumping around. My sister was thrown off and she ran back to the house. I stayed behind and was blinded by a puff of dust. When I could see again I saw the horse but it had the body of a buff person. It started chasing me around the race track and my family was watching me from the porch. I tried to get their help but they just stood there laughing at me. My point of view changed to my sister and I could see myself getting chased by this buff horse and that's when the dream ended.
276,"I believe it was always my point of view. I don't remember a lot, but my roommates were gone and I thought they died, and I was scared and sad because I didn't know where they went."
277,"My recent dream involved me and a few friends going to the tetons and renting a cabin. The dream was in my perspective and was a single day of the trip and started off with me sitting at a table eating breakfast with my friends. I felt very relaxed but also super tired which kind of sucked and I was eating bacon and breakfast potatoes. It then sort of skipped to us packing up to go on a large hike though I do not remember the trail. We packed snacks, drinks, and our swimsuits as we knew there would be a lake along the trail. As we started, I remember feeling relaxed and happy as it has always been on my bucket list to experience the tetons. Through the hike, my friends and I talked a lot about life and how we will never forget this. Here and there I would take photos of the beautiful scenery with my new camera which made me feel accomplished because the photos started to become better as the trip went on. As the hike went on, I started to feel a little tired. The dream then sort of skipped again to the lake we got to and I remember me and my friends swimming for a while because it was such a nice lake and the scenery was immaculate. We played with a football and took a ton of photos. We then changed back into our old clothes and made our way to the peak of the mountain. As we got to the top the sun was beginning to set and the sunset was insane. I remember one of my friends saying ""wow"" as it was the coolest thing he had ever seen. We all took the time to appreciate everything in front of us while taking numerous photos. I remember the dream feeling super relaxed and almost like a video edit because of how cool it was. As soon as we started to leave, the dream stopped and I woke up."
278,"there was this murder and no one basically had any leads. there was a man in a shallow boat like structure and he was bloody but still in one piece. me being me i went to the crime scene multiple times to see if i could find anything. well it‚Äôs dark now and i see this truck pull up and this man get out. he does something i can‚Äôt see (to the crime scene) then gets in a drives off. well days later a women shows up to me and rushes me away ‚Äúwe have to go now it‚Äôs not safe here‚Äù so immediately i‚Äôm like woah who are you and she never answers..then there is a hole in my dream and it skips to a point where the woman and the man i saw earlier have confronted eachother . well the short way of telling the end of this dream is woman (red hair pulled into a pony tail,skinny structure,kind of short but tall too so average height, green eyes, wearing an all black wet suit almost) has now killed the big man in the truck after a long fight over something i have no knowledge of(big muscular man,no hair,black jeans,white t shirt,reddish brown beard,black shoes) and she‚Äôs now bagging up his body and throwing it in the dumpster across the riverside. then somehow we‚Äôre inside and there‚Äôs now blood everywhere but i don‚Äôt remember why. she‚Äôs scrubbing vigorously trying to get rid of any traces. by this time it‚Äôs daylight and the cops are arriving. well the women freaks out and goes to the door acting calm as ever and tries to talk them out of needed to search the place. well it doesn‚Äôt work so she hits the cop over his head and we are now running. that‚Äôs when i woke up)"
282,"The most recent dream I can recall took place three nights ago. I was back in high school, but it was some kind of mix between the high school I attended, Free State High School, and a school from a 1970s-set high school movie like Dazed and Confused. The school had 4 floors and a huge open courtyard, overlooked by balconies connected to classrooms. Outside of the school, the dream was mostly set in the car that I owned, a teal 240SX. This car was extremely quick, but handled like it had no steering wheel and was unpleasantly uncomfortable. No matter how I oriented myself in the driver's seat, I was always too close to the dashboard and couldn't press my foot on the clutch to change gears. My extreme happiness of owning the car was at times ruined by the moments when I couldn't control it. When I wasn't in this evil car, I was skateboarding with superhuman skill at the skatepark behind the school."
283,"I dreamt that my boyfriend and I were in a ghost town alone and he got really drunk and was super annoying and rude to me and then kept disappearing and being very hard to track down,"
286,I had a dream I was sleeping at my boyfriend's house and his roommate came into the room when I was asleep
293,"I was at my skating rink, and I had broken my ankle. It was a nice day outside, the sun was shining and i was coming out of the front doors about to walk down the stairs. As I was walking down I broke my ankle, and it hurt really bad. I sat on the ground and tried to call my mom. She picked up the phone and didn't really care what had happened to me. I sat there crying and I could feel the pain of the sobbing in my chest. I couldn't catch my breath because of how much I was crying and how much my leg hurt."
294,"I had a dream last night that I had to have a lab meeting with my mom and we for some reason had Indian food. Anyways I think I had it because I am worried about meeting with my research lab on Thursday since I have not done enough work for it yet. I think my mom being in my lab meeting in my dream was a sign that I need to get my work done so I do not disappoint her. Except at the end, it got less stressful because everything ended up okay and we all just ate the Indian food together. But now I am stressed about doing the work again after having the dream."
297,That i was swimming and I won the olypmic gold medal
298,I was at a mountain resort with my boyfriend it was very golden and Red colored. There was a buffet with so much food. It was my birthday and it was a surprise party for me. Friends were there. It was exciting
300,"It was like a monster survival situation. I knew that it was a dream so it was a bit thrilling but still felt a bit scared because I might still be able to feel pain. I was at my apartment when suddenly monsters started to flood in. I hid inside a brown mansion and eventually survived, even with the threat of some popcorn monster that disguised itself as a harmless snack."
304,"I was dreaming that the only ay to fic my mirror in my room was to change the batteries. I didn't really feel a certain way towards it, it was just a situation that happened."
305,i was happy and dancing with friends
308,i was going to texas with my boyfriend and all of my friends and it was alot of fun.
315,I was in my dorm room (first person) and on the other side of the jack and jill bathroom was my old crush.  I had no feelings for him but he kept trying to add me on socials.  I told my current boyfriend and he broke up with me.  I started crying and could not control myself.  I woke up with tears in my eyes.
324,"I had a dream the other night, and I was in a hair salon, and I was sitting in the chair playing on my phone, and when the hairdresser said that she was done, I looked up and she had given me bangs. I had not told her to give me bangs, so I was very shocked, but they actually looked good, and I liked them, so I didn't get mad at her. I remember feeling scared when I saw them, but I relaxed once I realized they looked good."
327,"I was back at home in Colorado. I was running on the hardwood floors in an anxious, panicked state of mind but I wasn't sure why. I realized soon that I felt this way because my crush was sitting in the living room waiting for me. I was shocked to see him as I walked downstairs, therefore I ran to my mom for help in the office, which was down the hall from the living room. I started helping her hang up the laundry that just came out of the washer. The shirts smelled clean and fresh, and they were slightly damp. I started nervously talking to my mom saying that he was in the living room, and she responded very calm and collectedly. She said she invited him over and I dropped the hangers in my hand. As I picked them up, I had a crazy impulse, and I acted on it. I ran out of the room and over to him, ensuring my mom couldn't see us, and I kissed him. Kissing him gave me such a rush because I had never kissed anyone before. As I ran my fingers through his hair, I quickly realized what I had done and I broke the kiss. I sprinted to my mom and I locked the door of the office behind me. I started panicking and I told her that I kissed him as she looked at me with curiosity. I sat down on the soft carpet. My mom started asking me questions about why I did it and how I felt about doing it. Some part of me was happy, but another part of me was so confused because I do not usually act on impulse. I stood up, thanked my mom for listening to me, and I walked out of the room. As I opened the door, I woke up from my dream."
330,I was sweating and scared when I looked down and saw that I had ring worm on my hand. This made me terrified I was thinking what will I do how will I make this go away its so gross. Then all of the sudden as im looking down at my hand the ring starts moving. this worm is crawling under my skin. I have never felt so much fear and disgust. I didnt know what to do so I ran to my mom to show her the sight of the worm moving around up my arm. My mom tried to help me get it out. Eventually somehow she did get the worm out and there was a feeling of relief but when i looked down again more had spawned onto my hand and I was back to fear and disgust. Then I woke up in a sweat. Worst dream ever.
337,"I had a dream about eating cheese puffs, and I thought it was so real that I woke up and literally licked my fingers."
339,"In the dream I had a ghost looming over me and I felt a sense of dread because I knew I couldn't do anything about it. Eventually, I had some sort of exam over something that I hadn't studied at all but when I got to my desk I fell asleep again and had a dream inside of my dream where I asked someone how to kill the ghost. I eventually got a special sword in my dream and when I woke up, I was no longer in math class but instead some parking lot and I found the ghost and killed it with the sword. I woke up from the dream immediately after killing the ghost."
342,"All of my high school friends cam and suprised me at college and it made me feel really happy, because i haven't seen them in a while and it has been hard without them."
344,"I dreamt last night that I was in a big house with my friends, some random people, and some of my customers from work. My friends and I were trying to solve a mystery/ investigate the house for the bad guy. There was a big conflict but the bad guy was eventually caught after my friends and I were all seperated and hid in fear. Then we all went to sleep in the giant house. We woke up, got ready to head home, and then one of my regulars tried to inadvertently flirt with me."
346,The dream was in first person where I started in an open field. There was a light gust of wind with the sound of the grass moving in the direction of the wind. It was dark outside with the only thing visible being the grass close by. I was frozen and staring out into the field and I quickly turned my head the right to the sound of a door opening. I turned back around to being in my room and feeling of panic that I was being dragged out of my body. I felt a sense of pressure and pain like i was being pulled up. There was no one else present besides me but I could hear breathing close by as i was being pulled up. As I kept being dragged fear and panic kept building up but i wasn‚Äôt able to scream until I woke up in a panic.
350,"I had a dream in which I was watching a movie with some of my friends, including people I had met from my training for a work position. My two friends were romantically involved and left without me, so I hitchhiked on a trash truck to get home."
352,"I recently had a dream that I was in the bed of a truck with a man without a face, but I knew that he had bad intentions and a knife. At this point, I was at a 1st person perspective. It was really dark and eerie, and there was a bunch of random dingy white cloth I was sitting around. It was night, and the sky was foggy and it kind of smelled like smoke, but the stars were still visible. The man brought from behind him this baby tiger with very bright blue eyes and he told me that I had to suffocate the tiger until it went limp or else he was going to hurt me. I was holding the baby tiger and just looking into its eyes for a while because they felt really alluring and like very lively. It was very cute, I was cradling it in my arms while petting it and I felt protective of the baby tiger. This was the only part of the dream that felt good. The man started yelling at me to do it, he was screaming very aggressively, and I was terrified, so I put one of the cloths over the tigers nose. It was struggling and squirming and I started sobbing because I didn't want to kill it so I took the cloth away and started running with the baby tiger in my arms. When I started running, it switched to a 3rd person perspective and I could see both myself and the man running through a large city with streets in the pattern of a grid. I kept trying to hide in alleyways and he kept finding me so I kept running. The running went on for what felt like forever. I went into a dessert store that was empty and hid behind the counter, but the man walked in looking for me again. I could see both his perspective and mine. I was breathing very heavily and still crying because I felt bad for the tiger and I was terrified but I woke up from the dream as the man found me behind the counter."
354,"I was on a boat with a police officer and a boy, the boy was crazy and ended up killing the police officer and his girlfriend on the boat."
356,"Recently, I have been stressed about my future, finances, and personal relationships. This dream reflected those fears. It was in first person, and the setting was vivid and realistic. I woke up in my bed, smelling bacon wafting from the kitchen. I couldn't tell it was a dream, but something didn't feel right. Unlike my room, there was nothing on the walls, across from my bed sat a small desk with a lamp, and the rest of the room was empty. My bed was hard, almost like it was made of cardboard, and I lay under a bright blue comforter and on a gray pillow. I heard a knock at the door. ""Come in"" I said softly, still unaware that I was dreaming. I looked up to see my father in the doorway. That was weird. I have not lived with my father for over six years at this point and have not spoken to him in four. I looked him up and down, he was older now. His hair grayed and his beer belly growing. He asked what my plans were for the day as if it were any other. This was the moment I realized I had to be dreaming, it sounded like him, and looked like him, but more similar to the image of him older in my head than reality. I asked him why he was here, and he said he didn't understand. I noticed his clothes, nicer than anything I remembered him wearing, and his hair was neatly trimmed. This has to be a dream, I thought to myself, feeling like it was all too real. I started to get emotional, bawling up and crying on the bed in front of my father. I felt fear, anger, loneliness, confusion, and most of all, wishing this version of my dad could have been reality. He came over to me, comforting me the way my mother always did when I was little. I wished he was this kind, this caring, but I knew it wasn't real, it couldn't be. I knew my father, and this man looked and talked like him, but was a version of my dad that cared. I started to get frantic, scared that this was a tactic he used to get close to me, deceiving me. Within the dream, I felt my body get hot, my chest get tight, and my fists ball up. When I looked up through my tears, the older version of my father was gone. Where he stood now stood reality, the narcissistic creep standing over my bed smiling at me as I cried. I screamed, then I awoke in my bed, at home."
357,"I was brought into work and told to sit down to talk to my boss, apparently I really screwed up and they said they would fire me and call the police. I ran out of my work at the hospital, and got into my car and then the police chased me but it wasnt normal police it was INTERPOL for some reason. I crashed my car on the run and that's when I woke up."
358,"A few nights ago, I had a stressful dream. I had straight hair, but my hair is naturally curly. I was trying to straighten my hair again because it was frizzy, but my friend Andrea wanted to do it. I remember her having a hot comb in her hand, but I was very hesitant to tell her that my hair would get burnt because it is not strong enough, or I don't have the correct curl pattern to withstand the heat of the hot comb. She told me that it would be ok and proceeded to do it. My hair is important to me because it is unique. My hair was burnt from the bottom in the dream, and I felt my heart sink. I was breathing heavy and didn't know what to do. Next thing I know, I see a lady with scissors behind me. The lady had brunette hair, and I know I've seen her before at Ulta. I told her I only needed the burnt pieces to be cut off and that my hair was originally curly, so if she cuts too short, my hair will shrink too much. I remember her cutting it too high, and I began to cry. I told her she did it wrong and that my hair wouldn't look right anymore. The last image I remember is looking in the mirror, having extremely short hair. This whole time, I felt stressed and cold. I was myself throughout the dream as well."
362,"This dream had no meaning. 

I was sitting on the couch in our living room watching The Simpsons (our meaning my family). We have 2 dogs, but they didn't exist in this dream. I was wearing tennis shoes, a t-shirt, and shorts. I was home by myself because it was Friday and I get home at about noon from school, and my family went to a store in a nearby city.

It was overcast outside, so the sky was gray and the air was pretty still. No movement from the trees and creepily, there were no animals outside. It had been probably 20-30 minutes since I got home. Then all of a sudden, the tv switched to the news and was talking about how people were urning into zombies and eating people. I tried to call my family members but none of them answered the phone. 

I didn't know if I should drive to them or not. I ultimately decided to stay home and hide. After about a week of chilling at home by myself, I went outside. It had only been a week and yet my whole neighborhood looked like it had been abandoned for years. Then my dream like fast forwarded and I was all of a sudden a nomadic person. 

I never found found or heard from my family and didn't know who I could trust, so I kept to myself. Like 3 months had passed and I was a seasoned vet. I had safehouses that only I knew about, I had learned multiple survival tactics, no matter how uncomfortable and unsanitary it was. I had also become desensitized to killing zombies and even had a few problems with humans. 

Then one day, I was scavenging a store when a little boy found me and asked if I could help him get back home. I asked where it was. He told me it was a college that he and his family took shelter at when everything started. I was thinking that this was going to suck since the college he was talking about was in a different city that was 40 minutes away if you drive a vehicle and take the highway. So this was going to be a long journey. 

Then my dream went fast forward again and we were there. We looked at the world a bit different now because we had survived many things like cannibals trying to eat us, raiders trying to take our stuff and leave us for dead, people trying to turn us into slaves, etc. We arrived at the school that I used to go to before the apocalypse happened. There were walls surrounding the place for security and they had guards who had spotted us and recognized the boy that I was carrying. 

We were tired, stinking, covered in blood and dirt, and we hadn't eaten in like 3 days. They opened the gate for us. I put the boy on the ground and both of us were hunched over and limping into the area. There were so many people there to see the return of this boy. Then we both started laying on the ground on our backs with our eyes closed and we both sarcastically said ""Are we dead yet? Please tell me we're dead."" Then the people started helping us up. Then my dream ended and my alarm woke me up."
365,"i recently blocked a girl i was best friends with. we were extremely close and i love her so much (platonically), i don't know why i did it but i feel so so guilty. i had a dream where she went on some kind of vacation with her family, and i wanted to make things right so some how i followed her. we were all on a cruise and i was sneaking between rooms, trying not to be caught. at the last second, as im hiding in the bathroom, she opens the door and sees me, and freaks out. i apologize profusely and try to be understanding of how she must feel, and she excuses herself because she's overwhelmed. then i wake up."
368,I had a dream that I was fighting my ex best friend.
371,My dream started with my friend being mad at me because I wasn't going to target with her but I don't remember how I found this out but then it switch to me being in a car with her and my other friend and my other friend was driving. I was in the backseat and we drove past this car going the opposite direction. I think our car kind of swerved into their lane but we didn't hit the other car. I looked back into the window and I saw the car had stopped and suddenly started reversing very fast at us. I started yelling at my friend to go faster because it was coming at us. It was so scary and I felt a sense of urgency but then I woke up.
372,"I was at my childhood freinds house after she had died, she's not dead in real life, and we were in her old bedroom sharing stories about her. her mom came in and got mad at us for being in her room then I woke up and it took a while to remember if she was really dead or not."
375,"I was playing a pick up basketball game with Darren Peterson, and we start to become friends"
385,"I had a dream that I woke up in my bed and my boyfriend opened my bedroom door. He is is basic training right now and I haven't seen or talked to him in three months, so the feeling I got in my dream was amazing. He came up and hugged me and we began to talk, but right as I was about to kiss him I woke up. I remember waking up and just feeling a pit in my stomach when I realized it wasn't real and that I was alone. In my dream it was almost like I could even smell him. Then I woke up and everything was gone. After an hour those weird and sad feelings went away."
388,I broke my old phone frequently and I just got a new phone. I had a dream that I was in a library and I reached for my phone and it was completely shattered and I had to tell my dad that I broke my phone
389,"In my recent dream, I went to visit my long-distance boyfriend. I remember walking around his campus and being in his apartment. I have vivid memories of being in a park. I remember feeling super happy and excited to see him. Now I'm not really sure how, but somehow my dream shifted really quickly to sadness and fighting. I remember going on his phone and seeing him texting another girl named Emily, and this led to a huge fight, where my boyfriend was extremely mean to me."
393,"i had a dream about my dorm, where i woke up and our window had broken open and popped ou,t and i had to fix the window and it was very scary and windy"
394,"I had a dream that me and my boyfriend bought a house together, and we brought the fish we got together about a year go, (true information) my pleco fish was huge, and jumped out of the tank, it was one of the fish tanks that's like built into a wood piece of furniture, sucked my boyfriends face, his dog who had just gotten a cyst removed from his neck tried to go eat the fish so I grabbed him because I didn't want him to eat the fish and accidentally ripped open the whole and has to permanently eat from a feeding tube. I felt soooo bad and was crying all around the house. A little later in the dream his mom asked why we already had a toddler room set up and I was extremely confused, so I called my sister and she came over to look at it with me, I then realized it was my childhood bedroom and my parents saved everything down to the art I had on the walls, and was saving it for my future child. I then cried and thanked my parents."
397,My point of view in my dream was first person. I was in a bedroom and it was dark but in a cozy way. There were white cozy curtains that didn't let any light from the window through and the walls were painted gray. I was under the covers and they were very comfortable and plush. The guy I have a thing for was there and we were talking. All of a sudden I was in the passenger seat of a red convertible and I saw myself from above. We were driving down a scenic road lined with trees that were changing as they do in the fall. I remember feeling anxiety at the point of being in the bedroom but freedom and thrill in the red convertible.
398,"The entire dream was in first person. I was in the French Quarter with my family looking through my grandmothers house after she had passed away. It is important to note that at this time we were on the second level of the house in a room  that was lined with windows on all four walls. It was midday, so the sun was shining through all of the windows. I had this immense feeling of comfort, warmth, and happiness in this room. Eventually, I had gone off by myself and had then found some type of secret passageway through the wall. All of the sudden I fell all the way down this dark stairwell and ended up in a pitch black room at the end of the staircase. The only light was coming from the crack under what looked like a door at the top of the staircase. I looked down to find that I was shackled to the wall in these extremely heavy chains. Once my eyes adjusted, I realized there were many people in this room that looked to be very emaciated, and they were almost pleading to be let out. There were these beings in the room that would come from time to time that looked very alien-ish. The best way I can describe them is those monsters called the Hollows in the movie Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children. Also, it is important to note that while in this room, I was filled with this overwhelming feeling of terror and hopelessness. I kept trying to escape but every time I would make it to the stairs I would be pulled back down the staircase by the chains that were shackled to my hands and feet. I genuinely believe this was some type of metaphor for Heaven and Hell or something alone those lines."
400,"My dream was from the first-person point of view for the entirety of it. I was in an unrecognizable neighborhood, waiting for my friends (real-life people I know) to pick me up so we could go to Worlds of Fun. I ended up missing my friend's time slot to pick me up because I was helping my dad garden at my neighbor's house. The next thing I remember was telling my friends that it was a good thing. I  didn't go because I got tests back from the doctor saying I had a cancerous tumor on my heart and liver. I started to feel afraid, and then I woke up very scared and wondering if I was ok."
404,"I tend to remember pretty normal dreams, especially if they were inspired or based on something from that day. In my last dream (yesterday night), it was obvious I was somewhat a part of the video game setting that I had been playing all day (Red Dead Redemption 2), set in the wild west, it started with kind of a mission or thought I had to myself, saying I could only wake up in my bed when my alarm went off when I had earned the sum of 1000$, which in a video game set a while ago was a lot of money, sort of insinuating that no matter how much time passed when i was in the dream none passed in real life, I started my life in the game becoming an orphan, which was kind of my way of setting myself up for a solo mission, that happened in the form of my parents (who in the dream looked exactly like my real parents) as owners of some small house in a kind of forested area came under attack, I remember in my dream it was either natives or outlaws, I wasn't too sure as in one part it was outlaws coming in to ransack and loot the house and then at the same time it was natives who threw torches in, burning it down, either way It shifted to me the next morning understanding what had happened, and starting to pack up supplies for myself, ammunition, things for the horse, all of which where in game objects in rdr2, in the dream for some reason i was much younger, referring to the prompt and attempting to answer as accurately as possible there was no smell or taste, or even point of view, I was just simply in it, I never saw myself or anything from my point of view, there where a few more ""scenes"" where I sort of time-lapsed through growing up, shoot a gun from off a horse, and be able to shoot targets well, the last thought before I woke up was about robbing someone, and if I should morally do it since it was just a video game, or since it was so realistic I felt as if consequences in general, the dream sorted ended there, probably when I went into a deeper sleep as I felt as though I didn't wake up from the dream, either way Im not sure if it is notable to the research but I slept through my alarm for 7, waking up at around 11:30."
405,"I was trapped in my childhood closet with people banging on the door, sitting in a pile of clothes with light coming in through the bottom crack of the door I was a younger child again crying trying to be quiet and not seen or heard holding my breath to be invisible but the person on the other side melted and slid through the door crack to reform and stand over me and when i tried to run my feet were stuck"
407,"This dream was in first person. I don't remember much but I remember who was in the dream. I was on vacation with my family and our family friends that we go on trips with. Their son is my age.
I remember feeling very happy."
408,"It was a dream about my last football game. I remember not being able to run, feeling the pain of being hit and feeling the emotion of playing in a game. It was very realistic."
409,"The whole dream was in first person, and essentially my parents kicked me out of the house (or maybe sent me away?) To live with my friend on his farm. I was attending college but had no financial support but I had to work overtime on the farm. For whatever reason, everything was in the color range of brown, orange, yellow or tan. Picture a stereotypical farmhouse made of only these colors next to an expansive wheat field. I remember feeling something not dissimilar to sadness, near hopeless and despair but still believing I could make this new life work, just that it would be significantly harder."
412,I was in a car with my family and we went around a corner of a street and a semi truck was besides us on the opposite side of the road and when we went around the corner the semi truck flipper over onto our car. I saw it land on us and then I saw white and then I woke up breathing really heavy and sweating and I was scared.
413,I was sitting in the dining room of my sorority house at a table with a bunch of random people I did not recognize. The only person I knew was who was sitting to my right which was Nic from Love Island. I remember it being in my sorority dining room however it felt like we were in an insanely busy restaurant. I remember it being very loud with a ton of background noise everyone was talking. I felt a feeling of comfort because even though the room was so crowded and loud Nic and I were just talking to each other and laughing about the fact that some man had just came up to him and asked for a picture. We were sitting in the corner of the dining room and there were big windows behind us and it was around sunset time.
415,I was getting prepared for my upcoming clarinet jury and was about to perform.
423,I had a dream that I was with my first boyfriend Lance. He was trying to get back together with me and his mother didn't approve of it because she doesn't like me since he and I was on and off so much.
424,"I remember being at a house with all of my friends and people at my school, everyone was in normal clothes and everyone looked and acted how they usually do everyone was having fun. Later than one of my teachers started to act weird with me and was slowly trying to assault me while the guy I liked was talking to another girl. I asked him to help me get away from my teacher and he didn‚Äôt care and went off with the girl that was from my school as well. I was then later assaulted and never looked at the teacher the same after even though it was just a dream."
426,"I was sitting in the school library worrying about some assignment that was due soon. I was really stressed about it and my leg couldn't stop bouncing. I was typing on my computer and doing the work, but nothing would show up on screen."
427,"it was first person, I was looking for my dog with my family, I felt sad and scared."
428,"I decided to take a nap in my dorm room, which lasted for about 45 minutes. In my dream, which was in first person, I was braiding my roommate's hair, when her boyfriend walked into the room with his friend and his friend's girlfriend. My roommate and the other girl started arguing back and forth, so I decided to step out of the room and go on a walk because it felt tense and awkward. I ended up walking all the way to Mass St., but it appeared very differently in the dream and was almost unrecognizable. As I was deciding to walk back, I was interrupted by a Halloween parade where candy was being thrown. I could smell the sweet smell of candy strongly, when suddenly, I felt intoxicated. I remember I had nothing to drink/consume in the dream the entire time, so I was very confused as to why I was feeling this way. I decided to ignore the feeling and continue walking back, ignoring the parade that was happening beside me. Suddenly, I face-planted on the floor and a bunch of my classmates from my high school were standing on the other side of the street laughing at me. I was extremely embarrassed and annoyed at this point, so I started walking to a safety point, which ended up being a warehouse. On the way of walking to the warehouse, I was almost ran over by about 10 semi-trucks in a row on the street. I was extremely startled by this, so I ran into the warehouse afterwards. Once I got inside, I realize that all of the semi-trucks were being shipped out from this warehouse and I felt as if I was being crushed inside. I felt a rush of panic, so I ran into the first empty space I saw in the warehouse. However, as I was trying to escape, the room continued to expand and there was no point of escape. It felt like I was in the backrooms and was running around in spirals. I decided to call my roommates and my friends, but nobody would pick up, so I turned around and went up a staircase, where I was met with a man. I shouted at him and pleaded for his help, but I was met to my surprise when he turned around. He had a severe case of scoliosis and kyphosis, along with having an extra pair of legs that were attached to his original legs. He agreed to help me out, but bombarded me with several questions before he let me leave. I was feeling very uncomfortable at this point, so I told him I had to leave. He suddenly got aggressive and pinned me down to the staircase with this 4 legs. I was immediately put into psychosis and I saw 4 images appear one after the other. It looked like a video game screen, the first image was telling me about my past, the second image was explaining my present, and the third image displayed my future. I felt extreme discomfort, like a heavy stone was pressing on my chest. I was unable to move an inch of my body, as I was laying supine from the floor with my head to the ceiling. I also started floating in the middle of these images appearing. The last image prompted a question of asking me my wishes, and he offered to grant them for me. I immediately snapped out of the psychosis and told him that I did not like this at all. After this, I woke up in a panic with a racing heartbeat and sweat dripping down my body."
432,"I was brought into a School that looked like a castle i was there with a group of people I didn‚Äôt know that specific group of people. We were given a tour then we were brought to a room some people from my high school showed up in army uniforms then they were taken to a room i ended up in the room with along with my mother, grandmother, and brother they were planning on stealing from the store, I remember feeling nervous about my brother being involved and at risk compared to the rest of us. I said I didn‚Äôt want any part but my mother said we need to then we could leave so I participated. I remember the store looked like the inside of hobby lobby but with items that were more valuable like jewels and i remember a row if dolls houses and thinking if we had the room i wold rather take one of those but we didn‚Äôt have time i tried making it quick but my family were taking to long i remember becoming irritated by having to wait. I was sitting in middle of the isle with my mother, and grandmother when i made i contact with a worker and older white women an i just new she new i felt my stomach drop but nothing happened my brother came over and said he needed to use the restroom and left it was a straight view of the bathroom there was a water fountain next to it I remember being switching point of views were my brother was in the restroom and found a note I don‚Äôt remember what was on the note though. Then i was taken back to my point of view i fell scared i was ready to wake up when it went black and i heard loud bang by the restroom my brother was in they it was like the swat team went in it i remember thinking that‚Äôs my brother in there then i woke up started and couldn‚Äôt go back to sleep."
439,Friend got into a fight
442,"In my dream I was in the Budig 120 lecture hall and i was being chased by a random girl that I didn't know, but I knew she was trying to kill me. I was scared and ran for my life jumping over the chairs on the upper level of the auditorium. I remember losing my shoes which were my brand new birkenstock clogs. I ran out of the doors eventually losing the girl, so once i knew she was gone i ran back into lecture hall and grabbed my shoes. I remember feeling an intense fear/ adrenaline rush when being chased by the girl and being very relieved when i lost her."
443,"i was just haning out in a neighborhood that awake i dont know but alseep i knew it because i had lived there for a while, but i go to this party its blue in there , people are drinking smoking dancing smilling and then i feel my right hip get hot and wet, i was shot and then i was shot 9 more times but it didnt hurt it was just numb and tingly"
445,"I recently had a dream where my step dad passed away. I remember being at the funeral and holding my mom hand, while comforting my little brothers. I remember feelings of despair, sadness, and grief. The funeral home was quiet and dark with stained glass windows, with the feel of a church. The majority of the dream was first person, until I gave a speech and it switched to third person."
446,"In my dream I was in a bar not too far off campus, it was loud and lively. Everyone was dancing and hanging out with their friends. I had too much drink and began to get dizzy and I couldn't focus like normal. I remember there being a boy who was around me the whole night, he confessed how he felt about me. At the time I wasn't sure whether what he was saying was the truth or if we both were just impaired."
447,A past coworker and I crossed paths at a coffee shop and they confessed to having feelings for me when we worked together. Since I've been away at college he was able to move on but seeing me in the coffee shop rekindled the feelings he was having and he wanted us to go out together. I was feeling shock and didn't know what to say to him. I told him that I would like to go out but I needed a little bit to decide how I felt about him. Him and I were good friends so it was strange to hear him say all these things about me.
459,"I have very mundane dream scenarios, but I always see very vivid color and I can experience sensations like taste, smell, touch. I had a dream where I was looking through an old abandoned mansion with a team and we had only flashlights. It might have been an abandoned museum because we saw items like dinosaur bones and other artifacts. I see my dreams through a third person perspective, like looking at a movie, but I'm also commenting on it, describing what it was like do be in this scene. So many times while my dreams are happening, I have an inclination of what's going to happen already."
460,"I was in a greenhouse directly from the set of Harry Potter. It was a dark and stormy night, which made the glass walls fog the outside world. I had an uneasy feeling as I was alone in a greenhouse full of weird plants. All of a sudden, I heard a dementor's scream (a flying creature from the Harry Potter series that sucks the souls out of its enemies) echo through the greenhouse. I instinctively ducked under one of the tables as the room began to freeze over. As I looked around, the shadow formed in the far window on the right. It slowly crept closer to my position and began to grow taller with each step he took. When he approached the window directly to my right, I saw the face of Voldemort (the main antagonist of the Harry Potter series, very scary-looking). He made eye contact with me and screamed with laughter. The glass shattered all around me, flying inches past my face, and Voldemort began to advance. I struggled for a moment, then screamed. Then I woke up."
464,All I can remember was that I was pregnant. And I was bad at taking care of the kid and was scared of what to do.
465,"In this dream, I was holding hands with someone I really liked. I remember the feeling of his hand feeling very real and that I was looking at our hand interlocked. We were walking and talking on a sunny day in a courtyard. Seemed like a fancy mansion courtyard where a lot of people were around us, They were walking and talking in their own conversations. Me and the guy kept walking and eventually stopped when there were a group of people wanting to talk to him. Not much I can remember after that."
468,It was first person. I was at school but it wasn‚Äôt quite my normal classes. I wondered around trying to get places and talking to friends. But there were friends there with me from my hometown.
471,I don't remeber much about the dream but i do remeber that I just bought this really nice white jacket a few days ago and I picked it up and it had a huge red splotch on it. I then thought wow this looks exactly like the reel I was watching a second ago then I woke up.
472,I was on a run and I stopped at at stop light and a car ran into me and I went to the hospital. My family came to see me then I started to die and then I woke up.
473,"n a big super market like a big Walmart with my sister Alex and all of a sudden a loud voice speaks to us about the groceries we were buying and everyone in the store was confused and everyone was scared. Next thing we know like five min later while we were checking out at the self checkout the same loud voice said something about hoping we enjoy something we‚Äôre buying and then saying, anyway this planet is MINE!!. And then a loud grumbling began and these minions of the boss started crowning the store and killing the people inside."
474,"I had a dream that I was able to get the Lenox Spice Village set, which made me immensely excited and happy."
476,I was in a baseball fiedl playing but I was a small kid and then din asourds attacked everyone and I was the only one alive then I woke up
477,"I dreamed that my ex and I were sitting in a field and talking about trying again and about how things hadn't worked before. It was just a super long, drawn-out conversation, and we were sitting under a tree, and it was just super peaceful. My ex is an athletic young adult with brown hair, and I am a young girl with light brown or dirth blond hair."
480,"It started off in a very busy very noisy bar, the bull outside section, with purple and blue strobe lights going off in a very dimly lit area. I was staring at my phone screen and was trying to coordinate a motorcycle deal in the middle east because I was working in intelligence for the government. The phone was not very vivid but more just a haze of light and I held it above my head. I then met a woman with a blonde bob haircut on the street who I knew was in relation to the motorcycle deal but seemed to be a conspiracy theorist/crazy. We walked down a street that looked like the end of Massachusetts street and 6th street in silence because what we were doing was ""bad"" and it felt tense, it was still dark and felt cold. She said she was being followed and I thought we weren't because she was crazy but agreed with her to be nice. I turned around as we were walking and a blob of a figure was walking behind us but it seemed like regular foot traffic. i turned around again and it was a black horse sprinting at us and i got really scared. I started hitting it and it held up its arms and threw blind swings back at me with closed fists as it was a man now. it felt really intense. Then it felt like that awkward point in a fight were your both to scared to fight so you step away and just start yelling and it was Bradley cooper in a bucket hat with a cut lip. He yelled that he wasn't following us but was just running. the he was holding a fishing pole with a hook on the end of it next to my neck to where I would know that if he ripped it it would catch my neck. Then I was holding a fishing pole next to his neck and I yelled back that he was getting too close and it looked like he was chasing us. I was panting and felt startled and embarrassed. Me and the woman kept walking and walked down some stairs to a bathroom that was the foyer with a door on one side. there was another person who felt like they were with us the whole time. The person sat on a counter just across the bathtub and there was a linoleum floor made to look like wood and was lit by yellow light. Me and the woman got into the bathtub and she morphed into my girlfriend. I felt really guilty I was with another woman and felt almost like i got caught by my girlfriend. Then my roommate from freshman year came in and tried to get into the bathtub with us and i had to push his head away and say ""no roger no"" kind of the same way you would with a dog. He was wearing jeans and a white shirt and his felt black and greasy in-between my fingers. both me and my girlfriend laughed each time he tried to get in and it felt very funny."
482,I met some family when I was with mine and they had three daughters and a big house with a huge pool and basically I just talked to the dad the whole time.
484,I went to a drake concert with my friends had a good time and went home with a girl
486,"I was at a forest covered summer camp with people from my high school and at the time guy I liked. We were all having a good time everyone looked the same but the inside of the cabin was very interesting and definitely run down, kind of like the scene of the lost boys from the movie Hook. I then saw the guy i liked with a different girl from our school which made me very upset. Later on on of our teachers became a killer and was trying to find me throughout the house and when I asked for help from my friends while they were playing dodgeball no one helped me and then i was later sexually assaulted by my teacher and then I woke up."

490,"This was the most recent memorable dream that I had, and it was my girlfriend's and i's wedding"
493,"I had a dream where I went home over Christmas break and I was in a playground with two random kids, one very young, like maybe 8 months old, and the other one was maybe 7 years old. There was a sort of school shooting or at least a terrorist attack. It was not very scary; I did not feel like this was really happening while I was sleeping. At some point, there was a rollercoaster, and we went in there,e but then we heard gunshots again and we had to run. Then we found a campsite with people who could help us. All the time I was carrying the young kid. I made me feel like I was a hero in my dream. I was not scared but it also did not feel very relaxing."
494,I had a dream that I went shopping with my friends and i saw someone random from highschool and i was just hanging out with friends in a dream.
496,My boyfriend threw up on me and i started crying. i hate throw up
497,I recently had a dream in which it was real life but I was Tinkerbell and the course of the dream was the exact plot of the first movie. I could not taste or smell. The people in the dream were those I see in my day to day life who were also fairies! It was a mixture of first and third person but mostly third. It was a funny and funny dream.
502,The dream was me coming back home to swim with my club team. I went over to the area right outside the locker rooms to see my best friend and give her a big hug. I was so excited to see her. But then I look to the side and these girls were judging us that we left back home. These were girls that I had struggled with before I left for college. They were always rude and held me to a higher standard than everyone else so it hurt.
505,"I rarely have lucid dreams, and I don't think I have ever truly experienced one. My dreams feel almost like words and ideas being displayed in a flash and sparking emotions within me. My most recent dream was of my ex-partner telling me he no longer wanted me and was moving on. I saw only his face, although no words came out of his mouth, I knew what was being communicated to me. I had this image of me running, trying to catch up, although it was very abstract and colorless. I felt sad and abandoned and woke up teary eyed."
506,"My dream was that there was a hurricane coming, and my dad and I had to evacuate wherever we were. We had to rush to put up window covers and pack the car with all of our stuff. I kept trying to pack my most important things, but every time I would bring stuff out to the car, I would forget something else inside. The sky was growing darker, and it was getting windier. My dad was moving slowly, too, and we had to stop for gas and to go to the grocery store. I remember feeling very stressed out that we would not evacuate in time. There were palm trees, but the surrounding area was somehow landlocked. The grocery store was a publixs. The town we were in was a little bit run down but not anything falling apart."
507,I was back in my old high school as a librarian.
509,"I was in a room unrecognisable, I was around my senior year of high school class. I saw Jesus Christ and I remember seeing His bright green eyes. I kneeled before him and started crying because I saw the eyes of my God."
510,"I was at work, with high school classmates as my coworkers. I love working and was having a good time, joking around. A particularly angry customer came in, and due to that I closed the store because I was worried the customer would hurt one of the employees (not sure why or who). I was feeling protective. After I closed, I was in my own home and my previously mentioned coworkers began sexually assaulting me. I was terrified and enraged, trying to fight back and doing whatever I could but it was no use. I woke up extremely afraid and uncomfortable."
511,"In my dream, I was watching a person who looked like me trying to steal my life. It was at a house with a pool in the backyard, and next to the pool iw where my clone and I got into an argument because she tried stealing my boyfriend in my dream."
512,"It was in first person, and this guy, Jacob, tall, lengthy, short (slightly grown out) brown buzz, I think I was outside in a park and he walked up to me and asked if I wanted to go on a date and I said yes and we hugged and then held hands and then i woke up"
514,"First person view, at a friends house the morning after a party, it was dark in the house but the light was coming in through the blinds, it smelled like dust, sweat, and a light scent of beer, I was talking to a guy I was with the night before, we were both hungover, I don't remember what we were talking about, but we started kissing, and then we ate food and then the dream was over. I felt happy, excited, and blissful."
518,"I dreamed that I was in my room and laying in my bed, when a huge spider dropped down from the ceiling by its web. The spider was black with yellow spots, and the web it fell from was white and long. I witnessed the dream from first person POV and it made me feel very afraid as I have a big fear of spiders."
529,no
533,"I dreamt that my cats got lost. And I did everything to find them. I found two of the three cats and I could not find the other. After I found him, he was dead. I think I had this dream because I am far from them now and I worry about them a lot. I know they are safe with my parents. I woke up stressed and it reminded me of my one cat that passed away due to miscarriage."
537,"I was at home In Wisconsin and it was snowy and I was driving and I couldn't stop the car when we were going down the hill, I remember I was with my friends but don't remember which ones, there was a gate at the bottom of the hill."
538,"I was in first person point of view. I went to a concert with my friends. I experience buying the tickets, getting ready, and heading to the concert. The feeling was very excited and happy. Sometimes I was in third person watching over all of us, but I was mainly experiencing everything. The exact details were blurry, like who exactly was I with and what I was exactly doing."
539,"In the dream, I woke up like it was any other day. The first thing I did was check my phone and to my surprise there were three different texts from people that I do not frequently speak to. I remember this acute wave of anxiety that came over me. My head was running wild with what it could possibly be able, thinking something had happened to someone I loved. I open my messages, and this is where it gets weird. All three of the people that texted me said ""I just saw your doppelg√§nger."" Mind you, they were all in different cities. My first thought was not that this was creepy but rather entertaining, since it was so uncommon for people to find doppelg√§ngers of me. I texted them all back, ""that is so crazy, you're the third person to say that to me today,"" but before I could send it, my phone went black, my apartment lost power, and I heard my front door open. At this point I remember realizing that I was in a dream but for some reason I could not wake myself up. My chest was tight and my body felt stuck. The door to my bedroom started to slowly creak open, and I woke up in a full sweat."
541,"I had a dream last night that I believe was triggered by a recent experience I had. In my dream, I was in the car with my grandparents and my sister when all of a sudden a large brown box appeared. It had a note on it that said it was a birthday gift from my great aunt. When I opened the box I saw that it was filled with cooked Mexican Rice. The rice was not in a package or anything, just filling the box. Mixed in the box was a singular package of grape flavored ramen noodles. My grandma told me I needed to just be grateful for my gift when I asked her why she thought my aunt had sent it to me. Throughout this dream I shifted from feeling very excited to incredibly confused. I believe I had this dream because my aunt had recently sent me a card in the mail for my birthday, but somehow I never got it."
543,I was at school my mom is on facetime with me here and with my friend at home and she is so mad at me and won't listen to me so i woke up annoyed with her but i know it wasn't real but it felt like it
553,The dream was 1st person and felt realistic as if I was fully alert and alive. I was in my old highschool during 3rd period study hall and was talking to an old classmate named lizeth. I can't recall what I was talking about but it was humorous as liz laughed. I then remember someone wheeling in an old projector set and putting on a black and white film. The film was incoherent and then the lights shot back on and I woke up from the dream and felt flashbanged as though the lights had hit my eyes in real life.
556,"There were 2 main acts in this dream. In the start I was in the basement of a typical upper middle class home with one male and female (the dream was 1st person point of view) I cant remember specific dialogue but for some reason we were on the run and were gonna fake our deaths so we took wrenchs and ripped out some of our back molars. we then used the blood and smeared the teeth and blood along the walls and the ceilings. There was a long time skip in my dream after this either because I forgot or my dream skipped itself to a police chase where the girl was driving a car and I was in the backseat with the man in the front seat, we were driving away from something and were scared and frantic, speeding along the road. We eventually had a line of cars infront of us and the car broke hard and then gunshots rung out and I saw the girl infront of me get shot to death I then screamed out and the dream ended. This is the second time I have had this exact dream"
558,I was in first person at a water park with my bestfriend who was a lifeguard at the water park. My boyfriend was there with his dad and brother hanging out at the water park. Then we saw his friends in a lounge pool and they are all football players and were screaming. I went to the bathroom.
562,I recently had a dream that I was traveling with best friend. my dad is a pilot and she wanted to bring drugs on the plane and we got in to a not so heated argument because I had to explain to her that just because there is no TSA we can still get in a lot of trouble and that its still illegal
576,"I had a dream about me playing basketball again(I have not played since sophomore year of high school). I was playing point gaurd and i could make any shot i took. I was in an empty basketball court in a middle school with purple padding on the walls, the only people in the room were the 5 people including me on my team and the other 5 people on the other team. I smelled clean hardwood floor, tasted sweat in my mouth, The other team was a mixture of skinny blond and black haired guys about my age. My point of view shifts to a referee, who had the same sight and sensations of me as a player. I do not remember a lot of the actions, other than playing the game and not being able to miss. It was a good feeling and I enjoyed the dream"
