"I was in uniform for the Army and I remember helping two other females around my age into a helicopter (doors off). I have flown in them several times, but for some reason this one I was stressed. The crew asked me to do one thing for the helicopter and I nodded, but did not which way it should go. I moved it and ""hoped for the best"", which is interesting because I always ask questions, and then we went up in the air. I remember we were stressed about a time crunch, and that I felt I was protecting and leading the two females I brought. There were two pilot and a crew chief, all males and all fairly older. I remember alarms going off and worrying, but then felt a sudden wave of peace. I knew we would be okay, helicopters are meant to roll. I was talking to the girls making sure they were strapped in while staying in my seat. Then the helicopter hit the ground, but it did not roll. That's when I got nervous. We were sliding on the left side, the side I was sitting on. I remembering suddenly the peace went away and this is not what helicopters are meant for. It was so real it was as if I could reach out my hand and touch the ground that was rapidly moving beneath us. We finally stopped and before I helped the girls out, I noticed one was bleeding from underneath her helmet and the other was slightly bleeding on her arm. I tried to speak to the pilots but they were both passed out. I took the girls up the side and we got out. I remember feeling dizzy as if it was hard to walk. I began checking out one of the girls head injury and then someone touched my shoulder and it was one of the pilots, who looked horrible. He said ""you have somewhere to be"" and I thought he was crazy, I wasn't going anywhere. Then he told me to hurry and suddenly I was in one of my best friends wedding as a bridesmaid (that wedding has already happened and I was a bridesmaid). We were all in the same blue dresses as in real life and had flowers in our hands. We were in a line, waiting to walk down the aisle of a white small barn looking building. I remember everything felt extremely bright. I thought did no one see the helicopter crash outside? How did I get here? How did I get into a dress? Then one of the bridesmaids began picking at my hair and saying it was not right, and saying I should have fixed my curls. Then I began to panic again. I was not prepared for the wedding what was I thinking. Then I went to walk down the aisle and saw a bunch of bright lights and then passed out. Some were worried but the bridesmaids were quietly yelling at me that I was ruining the wedding. I sat there wondering why no one was concered there was a helicopter crash. I wandered if the crew was alright. Then I went to stand up and saw stars, and I felt myself passing out. Then I woke up. Sweating."
I honestly dont really have dreams that I can remember. The most that I can remember is if I see a face I recognize and that is typically someone I interacted with earlier on in that day. The locations of my dreams are also typically places I have been recently. Any other specifics I rarely remember though. My two most recent dreams were in my friends house and all I can remember are their faces and the location. And the other was in Rusty Taco and we were sitting in the corner booth. Thats really all I can remember from them though.
The setting was all white except for an old-styled diner booth. the booth was scalloped and sparkly teal with a grey metallic table. I was sitting on one side of the booth from an actor's perspective and my grandpa whom I never met before he died was in the other side. the view never changed in my dream. overall it was him asking me about recent events and how college was going. I was happy to see him and I was upset when I woke up
"I was the actor, I was in my home after a basketball game that was about an hour away. I was home alone and got a call from an unknown number. When I answered, I was greeted by a Sheriff who informed me that there had been a car accident with 4 people. Two of them had passed away and two were in a critical state and were being held in the ICU. When I asked who they were, he told me that there were two adults and two teenage boys. My family. I dropped to the floor in a panic and started to cry and felt an immense amount of emotional pain. I remember feeling like I was sinking into the floor and everything was dizzy and cloudy. I then drove to the hospital that was 20 minutes away and saw the bodies of my parents and then walked to the ICU and saw my two brothers mutilated and hooked up to wires keeping them alive. I sat distraught in the room that held them both as the nurses and doctors told me about their issues and what I should expect. Everything was a mumbled mess and I was not able to coherently hear what they were saying. They told me that I should sign a release form that would unplug the equipment, ending their lives. I began to scream and curse at them, and it escalated to a physical fight between myself and the nurses trying to calm me down. I was then handcuffed to a chair and sedated. When I woke up, I decided I needed to call someone to help me with the decisions. I called my grandma who lived 5 hours away, and she told me that she was on the way. I then called my brother's girlfriend's mom, who was a close friend of my parents. 

While lucid in the dream, I came up with different scenarios, one of the others being that my older brother was not involved in the accident, and I had to call him and tell him the news. I then had to plan the funeral, sell the house, and pack up all of my family members' belongings, as I was the only one able to. I woke up in a sweat with a pounding heart.

"I was at a house party, but the house was like a mansion. My two roommates were there with me and so were my 3 other friends from my hometown. The lighting was a deep shade of red, and there were no over head fluorescent lights at all. There were tons of people there that I had never seen before and the whole time I was trying to find a certain boy. I was very happy and was really enjoying the night. I don't remember speaking at all in this dream but I do remember that there was a basement people were going to using an escalator. This dream was from my own point of view. It seemed as if the only people who really noticed my presence at this party were my own friends. No one was actually doing a particular activity, everyone was just standing around talking to friends and listening to the loud music. At the end of the night I ended up falling asleep on an arm chair after I had found the boy I was looking for. I woke up again on the arm chair and my friends and I talked about what had happened the night before."
In the beginning of the dream I was standing on a hill next to a water lagoon. There were several people laying around the lagoon as if they were on vacation. The lagoon looked bare with only dirt to sit on. A large dinosaur cam up from the lagoon and picked up a woman by the waste. The woman looked scared and was trying to get away from the grasp. The dinosaur had a very long fingernail or single claw and it pushed the claw into the front hairline as if to open up a canned soda and peeling back her scalp. That is when I awoke from my dream.
"I was going in to take an exam for school and felt disorientated as I was walking through the halls. The hall in question was a mix of glass windows and painted on green cinder block, but not in a way where they were side by side, but more so that they were partially glass while also partially cinderblock (the best way to describe it is a drink that's clear but also opaque at the same time). If there was any other people there, I don't recall I was focused on taking an exam. From there I would wander for a bit until I got to the hall and began taking the exam. No other people were around me from what I can tell, but the exam was difficult that it prompted me to turn in my sleep(this was observed when I woke up as I was turned 90 degrees from my original sleeping position). However, the contents of the exam from what I could recall were stuff that I had done before in a prior class, but emotionally speaking I felt like it was the hardest thing in the world that I couldn't do and just sat there increasingly frustrated at myself that I wasn't able to do it. Eventually some time passed and I finished the exam but I somehow knew that I had failed it miserably."
The most recent dream I had was me being at a high school party this girl I knew from high school was there and we were not friends. She brought up a past situation from the same party a year before. There was a fight between me and one of her friends but I won. Then a new fight broke out with a different girl this year and I almost lost. It made me sad and upset because I felt weak despite going to the gym.
"I was sitting on the floor in my room with the lead singer from my favorite band, Nicotine Dolls, and we were talking, but I don't remember what it was about, and I remember wanting to hold his hand really bad. I struggle with physical touch in the real world, so holding hands is a big deal for me. I finally grab his hand and just start messing with his hand while we continue talking. He was shocked at first but then carried on the conversation. I remember that his hand was cold but not freezing, more clammy. I also remember the texture of his hands, feeling the indent of the lines on his hands. I felt calmer after doing it although it felt like my heart was beating really hard from how nervous I was."
"I had the dream of me going back to my home country and not coming back to US again for ever. My parents and siblings were all stopping me to go back to the University and were assuring me that I'll be happy there. I was so on the fence if I should stay back or not ,however I came back to US at the end of the dream .I don't  think that my perception really changed because of the dream. At some point, in the dream I felt overwhelmed by my close ones stopping me back, but since I knew that I've to eventually return , I stayed firm on my decision and ended up being practical than emotional."
"I was in one of my friend's houses. I have never been to her house but it started out being in the living room. Me and my friends were playing a game of Roblox at a party. I remember leaving the family room to go upstairs and grab some of my stuff because I was spending the night there. The staircase was mechanically controlled, and I could choose if I wanted to go down the stairs or up the stairs. I chose to go up because that is where my stuff was. I entered the room and was gathering some things when another friend approached me. She asked if I was able to have lunch with them tomorrow and I told her no because I was meeting other friends (this was something that did happen earlier in the day in real life). She follows up asking a question. ""Are we friends?"" At this point, she is standing very close to me. I start to say ""Yes, but..."" and she took a step back. I tried to explain to her that boundaries were something that we needed to discuss between our friendship, and she was really offended by that. She then went around the room (same bedroom upstairs) telling people who had just appeared that I was not a good person. I decided it was time for me to leave the house so I gathered my things, walked down the stairs, and went into the living room. I remember when I entered the living room I reached under the couch that was against the wall and grabbed a box of donuts that I had stashed there earlier. On that same couch, one of my friends was making out with a guy that she had met through one of her classes and has started talking to him. I left the house, which was at the end of a cul-de-sac. By this time, it was night and the house next door was having a pool party for a bunch of little kids. As I was walking to my car, I remember seeing some kids run into the backyard with some floatation devices and a group of kids (2 boys 2 girls) came up to me as I was getting into my car and asked me if I was a basketball player. I told them no in a polite manner but told them I could tach them someday how to play. I got in my car, drove away up the road because the house was at the bottom of the hill on a cul-de-sac and drove back to my house. I drove and drove until I hit a stoplight. This is where I woke up."
It was scary
"I was traveling with my ex (my gf at the time), and we were driving across European countryside. It was a long drive, and we were driving through lush green valleys too, but small towns as well. The weather was damp (like Scotland), the vibes were like scotland. We stopped in a small town at this weird building that was like an old inn, but there was no one inside. It seemed like it was too late so the owners of the inn where in the cottage next to the inn. There was a bar inside the inn, but there was barely any light in. I am not sure if it was my sister/gf/mom who did but they went to the bathroom which happened to be right next to the bar table. Somehow, we rested and its almost morning, so we are about to leave and we just get in the car, and the owners(i am guessing), come out of the cottage and see and get angry, but by that time we leave in a rush. Note that, somewhere along this, the number of people increase from just my gf to my mom, sister, and my older brother i think? 
So we leave in the car and try to continue our journey and escape that small town. On the way out of the town, i see a weird man/farmer on the side of the road waiting and just smiling while i drive past him. We drive the rest of the day and then reach this house that we think is a good point to stop. We go upstairs and there's a courtyard that we check out. But suddenly there's a shooter on the neighbours roof trying to shoot us. We all crouch down, but my mom does not. She gets mad at me and disapproves of my decisions, and almost get shot, but my gf pushes my mom so she falls down and gets saved from the shot. (My mother does not approve of me dating a white woman - my gf is white and she cares about my mom which maybe the reason i noticed that in my dream)
We try to leave the house, but as we go back into the living room from the courtyard, there is a baby in a cradle in the middle of the room. Its almost that assasin came and put the baby just to freak us out. We realize that there are people in the house, so we leave immediately, but there is that constant threat. Because I am not supposed to be there. People are after me, and that is why they are trying to hurt people around me as well. 
To me in the dream, I am constantly trying to just make it to some scandinavian country. TO escape to the edge of the world.
My point of view throughout the dream was mostly from an observer point, except when we were at the courtyard.
During the dream, i realized it was an important dream, so i started saving and encoding those incident through categorizing, or using other familiar examples to save them."
"I was with my family at my grandparents house in Puerto Rico, in the dream I had a child and I felt that I had to protect him all the time because I loved him more than anything. It was Christmas eve and we were all eating and talking about life and stories. I remember my aunties talking on my back saying that I was too young to have a kid and they never expected me to have one. This dream was very meaningful because I don’t have kids neither I’m pregnant, so I felt like a mom. In the dream I was an actor, and when I woke up from that dream I felt very empty inside and sad."
"In my dream, I was inside a house. I had never seen this house before and didn't know who it belonged to but there were a few other people inside the house too. One girl, was a girl I went to high school with that I do not particularly like. The other people, I have no relationship to in my real life. One of the other people in the house told me that someone in the backyard was breaking into the car. I ran outside to see a man hunched over the backseat of my car, he had out something in the car. When he came out, he didn't look quite normal. He looked like he was uncanny valley. There is a trend on TikTok right now, where people make themselves look uncanny valley, which I had been seeing all over my phone. He did not say anything, just walked away from the car. Once he had left, I went to look into the car. I saw a box and opened it to find off brand girl scout cookies. In real life, my mom had just sent me girl scout cookies from home. Everyone in the house told me not to eat them and then I woke up."
"My dream was about World War 2 and the Holocaust. My family has been in hiding waiting for the war to end. The war wasn't coming close to an end and so my family decided it was safer for us to hide in a forest and escape to a different country where they were accepting Jews. The majority of the dream was in a dark forest in Poland. The forest was wet and muddy due to rainfall and storms, the air felt heavy and it smelled like nature. I heard gunshots, people yelling, screaming, and blaring sirens in the forest. Some People and families had the same idea of hiding and running away through the forest in order to be free from antisemitism. There were different days in the dream, and each day there were fewer and fewer people I saw in the woods because they had either been captured and sent to the concentration camps or were shot and killed in the forest and left there to rot. I had to be careful of where I stepped because I couldn't and didn't want to make a lot of sound in the event that the nazis and guards were right behind me. I remember being out of breath and sweaty most likely because in my dream I was running but also it was anxiety-provoking. I kept waking up hoping that if I woke up it will disturb the dream and I could go back to sleep and dream a new dream, but that wasn't the case. I picked right back up where I left off in my dream. This dream was repeating itself; run and hide, run and hide. At some point in the dream, I tripped over a big log as I was running away from the nazis because they were right behind me. I fell face-first into the mud, and when I raised my head up, I saw a nazi standing over me with a gun pointed at me. My back was propped up on the log and I was shot in the chest. My eyes rolled back and then I woke up. I closed my eyes again and I went back into the part where I left off. Even though I was shot in the chest I still was alive."
I had a dream recently about working in my old high school job at crumbl cookies. In the dream I am sitting in the back of the store sitting on a stack of boxes watching my coworker's work. Then my manager came back and asked me why I wasn't working. I told her I wasn't working because this is not real and I'm dreaming; then I woke up.
I had a dream that my oldest and younger brother were arguing in my grandmother's hallway. I am very close with both of them so this was very frustrating. Then my older brother was so mean that he made my younger brother cry. So I went up to my older brother and shoved him. He then fell over and had a heart attack. I was then crying and cradling him. This was really scary because I am the closest to my older brother even though he is mean to a lot of people. I have also always been so scared of him passing away because he has a rare heart condition that caused him to be in and out of the hospital as a child.
"I was in hawaii, because I was in college there. I was just coming back from winter break, however, there was a flood that caused a lot of stores there to be flooded and school was cancelled. I remember going into a store and the lady there was telling us we couldn't go into a specific area because it was still flooded and to be careful at the beach because of the flood. It was also kind of dreary there at the time of the dream. I kept complaining how bored I was."
"I had a dream that I missed the 43 bus at Daisy Hill, I was upset because I was right there, yet I missed it"
From what I remember I was in my house and both of my parents were sitting at our dining room table. I was little and our little white shih-tzu dog was sitting on the floor. All of a sudden my mom screams that we won the lottery. I remember feeling so happy and excited that we won the lottery. We immediately started planning everything we were going to do with the money. Then I remember we went to this tropical island all to ourselves and we were on the beach playing in the ocean. I remember that I felt super relaxed and like I was in paradise. Then that's all I can remember from that dream.
I had a dream a bunch of flies were flying around my room and landing on me. I know I felt scared and stressed out. My pov stayed the same it was from my point of view.
"I dreamt that I was out shopping with my paternal grandmother, my elder sister, and my mother. We left one store and entered another, however, somehow, a wad of cash from the previous store ended up in my grandmothers purse. This was completely on accident as when we discovered the money, my grandmother was distraught and in tears. The shop owner of the current shop we were in believed my grandmother could have stolen the money from the previous shop so he insisted on searching her. While my mother and I were comforting my grandmother, the wad of cash that was taken from my grandmothers purse and left on the counter went missing. I immediately knew it was my elder sister who stole the money and I accused her of so. It became an all out screaming battle as I told my mother I knew my elder sister was using drugs and thats why she stole the money. It was very angry and tense. I then woke up."
"My most recent dream I remember was when I was inside a glass room in a glass house in just my underwear. My perspective kept on switching between my first person view and third view. The glass house had no doors beside the one when entering the house, which was made of a material that isn't glass, maybe wood. Inside the room I was in, there was bed and TV and I was smoking a cigarette. The TV was playing ""Bill Nye the Science Guy"" but the topic he was teaching was different. In my dream, it portrayed Bill Nye as an infamous hacker that was wanted by the government, it didn't directly show it on the TV but for some reason that was my common sense within the dream. Anyways, in the episode he was teaching students on how to kill people and how to create a bomb. When I was watching the show, I felt like I sucked into the show. My point of view when I was sucked in felt like I was a viewer but it felt close enough that I was there, it's kind of hard to explain. After watching Bill Nye demonstrate how to incapacitate a person, I was back at the glass house (Again in first person). After that I felt unexplainable urge to leave and so I ran out of the house in the dark only to stumble upon a random door, it then switched to the third person perspective (I don't remember if it was the door that belonged to the glass house or a different door). I tried getting in but couldn't so I smoked another cigarette and then I woke up. This one was so weird that I can vividly remember it."
"The dream began with my mom sitting in a chair in a sterile room. She is a woman in her high fifties with blonde hair and brown eyes. The environment smells like a hospital would with blank, white walls. Nothing else is in the room besides my mom in the chair and the observer (me) sitting in a chair across from her. I begin talking to her about some medical condition, but I can't remember what it was just that it made me upset and sad to have the conversation. Throughout the entire conversation her face remained still with no emotion. This was the entirety of the dream until I woke up."
"I had a dream about more content for a video game coming out, but I could not play due to being away from home since I was at college. I consequently deleted all forms of social media to avoid spoilers."
"I was at my apartment with my boyfriend and my roommate sent me a Snapchat at 11 pm. I thought it was really weird because she is always in bed and asleep before then. I talked to my boyfriend about how it was weird, and he agreed. Then I walked out of my room and looked in her room and she was gone and her bed was made. So when I saw she was gone I opened her Snapchat and saw that in the background she was at an apartment I had never seen before. I got worried and asked her where she was and then I woke up from my dream. I remember laying in my bed in the dream and feeling warm and when I got up (in my dream) I felt worried. I also remember my roommate's bed being perfectly made like she makes it every morning so it felt really realistic. I mainly felt confused and worried throughout my dream. When I first talked to my boyfriend in my dream I remember laughing and the feeling of comedy and joy until I figured out my roommate was gone."
"I had a dream that I had woken up past the time of my alarm which was originally set to 8 am and I woke up at 5:32 pm. I had ended up waking up around 8:30 and thought I had missed my class but I had not. I was in my bed and check the time on my phone, both in my dream and when I woke up. I felt anxious that I had overslept but I also felt relief when I realized it was a dream. I was in first person view and it stayed the same throughout the dream. The dream was short so I only saw a first perspective of what I see in the morning which is my bed covers and my phone (my room around me)."
"It started with me rushing GPhi at Kstate (i don't think there is a gphi there) but event though I was already initiated I still had to ""pay my dues"". It was a football game day but there was also a social that same night. one of my friends from UNL was there suposidly dating one of the football players and we all signed a football with our predictions for the end score of the game. After that I had to ask to go to the social and they said no but and I remember feeling so embarrassed and ignored, and defeated. But then my friend from UNL said we could go to her friends bday party (this was strange because she like does not drink at all) and we get to the party and are having a good time then there are girls from GPHI at UNL there that I found out before I transferred they were spreading rumors about me. I was scared and mad because I didn't want the people at my new school to believe I was this horrible person that the false rumors made me out to be. So when the main girl Abby confronted me at to why I was at 'her' friend's party, I simply said I was with some new friends. She then proceeded to get the rest of her group from UNL to come and bombard me with horrible things and threats if I didn't leave so I ran away crying. My friends meet me in the bathroom and tell me that the UNL girls can't ruin my night. So I come out of the bathroom with confidence and tell the girls to back off and leave me alone. To which Abby pouts off and goes and finds the guy whose bday it is and pouts to him and tells him all these fake things about me till he comes over and tells me I need to leave. I'm shocked, hurt, and embarrassed all over again-- how is this girl still ruining my life? Then I woke up with tears on my face."
"The dream is fragmented, but I was driving a car inside of a building. I was trying to find a way to get it outside because I knew I wasn't supposed to be driving inside. At one point I had to drive it down a short flight of stairs and was concerned that it would damage the bumper. 

The next segment, I was again driving; however, I was traveling south on Hwy 1 in California, I was north of Waddell Creek near Ano Nuevo State Park. It seemed like the dream was on repeat because I would make it past an area of the highway that is set between a steep cliff drop off and a cliff wall that is notorious for landslides. I wasn't concerned about a landslide; rather, I was concerned that the ocean kept rising and the waves were reaching the highway. High tide was coming, and the water was threatening to cover the road entirely. Each time I would make it past the stretch of road, I would turn around and drive it again. It seemed odd that I wasn't scared driving north on the highway, only on the drive south. The last trip south, the tide came up to the road and started to pull the car out to sea. I had someone with me (I'm not sure who, but I think it was my son), and I kept trying to find traction with the wheels. I woke up at that point, but I can remember feeling the wave like motion and I wasn't concerned about myself, but I had utter terror that the person with me was about to die."
"I was in some type of bar... somewhere I have never been. There were a lot of people there and I knew most of them, but wasn't super close with a lot of them anymore. Most of them were people I used to be close with, but don't talk to as much anymore. I am having the best time ever getting to catch up with all my old good friends... all of a sudden like 5-8 people dressed in all black with big guns come down from the ceilings and start shooting at everyone. Me and my old best guy friend dive down behind the bar and see a lot of the people we know get shot. All of a sudden my bestfriend (who I hadn't seen in this dream yet) gets shot, so I run out to try to save her. The guy that was behind the bar with me comes out too and then I look up and one of the shooters is pointing the gun at all of us. The shooter pulls the trigger and I wake up."
"The last dream I had that I can remember fully is a dream I had about going to a party. I was in a house that was two stories tall and had a balcony on the second floor. I was myself but I also felt younger, like I was a senior in high school again. I had my original brown hair color with a black crop top and jeans. I felt happy and drunk and out of breath from dancing. The music was loud and were basic party songs like Kesha. I was drinking a lot, it tasted like some kind of vodka drink and I was dancing everywhere. I then went upstairs and started making out with my girlfriend in a room with my old friends. We then passed around a joint and smoked. I then laid down on a bed and watched the ceiling spin as I smiled. That was then the end of my dream."
"In this dream I was the actor and I was myself, but the environment changed frequently. I remember distinctly not having clothes on but sometimes having a towel on (not sure where it came from) but I felt embarrassed because a lot of my college and hometown friends were there and could see me naked, but I didn't want to be seen that way. However, they were acting completely normal and like nothing was wrong with me, but I still felt very self conscious. The environment I remember most was being in a rundown part of a city while it was gloomy and raining and everything had a slate grey/green glow. In that part of the dream, I had a towel to cover myself partially with but I don't remember my goal in being there. I only remember looking around in the sewer drains in the street and at the dark buildings, following the crowd of my friends, and trying to keep the towel around me situated so I was covered up. I know I was in other places as well, with a very similar plot, but I do not remember these places well enough to describe them in great detail. I only remember that at least one of them had a lighter environment where it was not raining."
"In my dream, I was sleeping in my dorm bunk bed and I was the actor. I heard someone open my bedroom door and I sat up and looked over and I saw a dark shadowed figure. I don't know who it was, but I felt like I knew them and they just stood by my bed. I screamed got out of my room, and quickly jumped down and off my ladder to my bed. I swung open my bedroom door and slammed it behind me. I ran into my main room and frantically opened the door and shut it behind me. I started to run down the hallway, because I felt like whoever it was, was going to follow me and that scared me. In the middle of the hallway, I turned and ran into the communal bathroom and hid in the furthest stall from the door. I sat on the toilet set and put my feet up against the door, in case the person walked into the bathroom. I felt an intense sense of fear, but I didn't know why and that's when I realized I was wide awake. I walked awkwardly back to my room but I was still scared of someone or something but I didn't know what it was. When I went into my room no one was there, and I felt crazy. I had to calm myself down and then eventually went back to sleep."
"It starts in a library on KU's campus (watson) that looks exactly the same as usual except it's the size of a small airport. I'm walking down the halls with my boyfriend and suddenly my backpack disappears. I tell him I need to go look for it and I walk across the library (which takes a long time because it's so big) and I start to feel really anxious because no matter how fast I try and walk it feels like im walking through thick snow, and suddenly all i can see is rows of the same white door with a gold handle. Every door opens into the same bedroom (small twin bed, picture frames on the walls, white comforter) and there's a blonde, college age man standing in the bedroom. He tells me to lay down and close my eyes and if I don't he'll hurt me, so I start running away back the way I came and he starts chasing me. I wake up before I can run out of the library but I've had this dream every night in a row for a week."
"In my dream, I was disliked by my boyfriend's parents. My dream felt so real that I was still sad after I woke up. I remember saying goodbye to their dog while being pushed out the door."
"This dream was from a few days ago, and it was in an amalgamation of the University of Kansas campus, the play place jungle gyms in McDonald's, and the Five Nights at Freddy's: Security Breach location all scrambled together. There was also some underground tunnels from this reoccurring location in my dreams: an older looking hospital type moment. It was in the first person, and I was myself. My friend Natalie was there and some of the people who live on her floor as well, in addition to a few of my other friends as well. In total, it was me, Natalie, Julia, Lydia, Spencer, and though he was not there, Sebastian was referenced by name. It was mostly dark and cold, and Julia would not stop crying; Sebastian just dumped her. We were running away from something, winding around buildings and alleys before we came across this building everyone thought would be a good place to hide. I was scared because it didn't feel right to me, but everyone ran in, so I followed behind. We stopped a couple times to talk and strategize, but it was all very frantic and not very well planned. Julia was still crying and sad, and I wanted to comfort her very badly and make her feel better. I wanted to hug her and hold her until she could breathe. And then we had to start running again because if we didn't something bad would happen. I didn't know what it was, though. We ran down some stairs and through some rooms that were only lit with emergency-lights. We got to a ground floor, where we ran down the hall to a garage/loading dock area. To the left there was a old rusted ladder that went down a few flights. One by one the group began filing down, as fast as possible. I brought up the rear, and the ladder broke while I was climbing on it. I fell on the ground and was stuck up in the ladder, and everyone ran through the underground sewer-like pipe tunnels and left me behind. I looked up to the loading dock where we just climbed down from and saw the things that were chasing us. they jumped down from where we just were and grabbed me- presumably to kill me- but that part was where I woke up."
"I was in the NBA which is a professional league for basketball players and I ended up winning mvp ""most valuable player"" which made me feel really good."
"I was riding a skateboard down my neighborhood road by a pond at sunset, then I got off the skateboard and went down to the pond water. A person was down there flying a kite. I got close to the water and was looking into it and then a snapping turtle jumped out and started chasing me. I ran away and the turtle couldn't keep up, so I walked home."
"I was with a group of my friends and we we're hanging out. Just having fun partying and enjoying each others company. This was like the first time we had met in awhile. I was all grown up and a sucessful business owner. My friend Moe was a physical therapist, which he's wanted to be his whole life. My two other friends were blue-collar workers. We talked for hours and had fun. Then joe ends up bringng back a bad memory of when I used to be addicted to gambling. He claimed I owed him millions, I started to laugh it off cause I was like your lying. But, then he started to be serious and be like Ill come after you and ill get that money. Then I started worrying because he'd never been like this. I started to get worried because he was going to expose me. Then it ended there"
"A dream I had a few months ago was unforgettable. In my dream, I woke up from my bed but I couldn't move.  My body was completely numb and all I could do was hear, and move my eyes.  I hear a man screaming at me, inaudible noises. and then out of my peripheral vision, I see my mom and sister in the corner of the room whispering.  I couldn't move my mouth and I was trying to scream to wake up, or gather their attention.  I was horrified.  I couldn't make out what the man was saying and I was fully aware I was dreaming. I was terrified I wouldn't be able to wake up. I thought that if I wiggled my toes I could wake up and so I attempted to try to move my feet and I bolted up and awoke."
My family and I were staying at a resort in Florida. The rooms were private and had a balcony and outside area that connected to the ocean/swamp by the resort. I woke up from bed and my brothers and I went outside. It was dark and one of my brothers was playing the water. All of a sudden an alligator bit him and dragged him down to the bottom. I screamed and my dad came running outside to save him. Then hundreds of alligators showed up and started swimming to the door. I ran inside and that's when I woke up.
"The guy that I like gave me his white essentials hoodie when we were eating dinner outside with our families on a set of those like wire outdoor furniture and all the bowls were fancy white china. I went upstairs to my childhood bedroom and changed and asked if he wanted it back and he said no, to keep it. It was very vivid and felt real when I woke up."
"A recent dream I had- 
I was trapped in a haunted house with people i felt like i knew but didnt know and i was trying to get me and 2 other little boys out as were being chased. Once we ran out I got yelled at saying ""you cannot leave without identification"" as the person i called in my dream to pick me up said the same thing. I woke up right after that was said."
"I was looking into a kitchen that belongs to a friend I haven't spoken to in a long time.  It's a dim lit kitchen with warm hues and it was night time.  I was peering in from the door that leads to the backyard.  I saw one of my current coworkers and best friend at the sink, I don't remember what he was doing but he was wearing his normal work clothes and was looking at the sink.  I could hear people in the living room and behind me in the backyard.  I saw that my friend was crying at the sink so I walked up to him cautiously because I know he doesn't like too much attention to his emotions and he doesn't like touch very much.  I went up to him and lightly touched his back and I remember asking him if he needed a hug and he turned to hug me.  He was still crying and I reached to embrace him and I felt wet all of a sudden.  He had turned into water and I was drenched in water.  I remember panicking and turning around frantically to see where he was and what had happened.  I was crying and hyperventilating but couldn't move.  I woke up drenched in sweat and crying."
"I was at my grandparents house but the side of the house where a wall should have been was open kind of like a doll house. They live in a two story farm house on a couple of acres so think large yard. The sky was orange like when a storm is happening during the day and a tornado warning was issued. I had several family members there, my aunt looked normal as well as everyone else. The only thing that freaked me out in the dream was michael myers. He was literally chasing me but not running, i could keep a good pace and we wouldnt catch me. I wasnt scared in the dream it just freaked me out a bit and was just like annoying to me, then i went into the front yard right while he was a distance away and woke myself up, like i told myself i was done."
"All I remember from the dream was being stressed about my exam for chemistry the next day, and I was freaking out if I was going to be late or not. I was in my dorm room and thought I had plenty of time to get ready but missed both my exam and the class after. I was very panicked and I woke up and told my boyfriend and then proceeded to wake up every hour because I was scared of missing the exam in real life."
"i was in the present time and I had received a message from my ex saying that he wanted to meet up and talk and i was like i have a bf now and he was like i just want ot talk and 
""clear the air"". So i was reluctant but i agreed, next thing i know we are sitting in a park of sorts and its sunny outside, still chilly outside though. But he basically states how he was wrong for not communicating and basically leaving me with no closure to the point where i decided to cut off communication. But then asked why i didnt just talk to him, and i was like ""cause you literally didnt talk to me at all, like absolutley no communciation to the point where i was over it and decided to move on. And he understood where i was coming from.Then my current boyfriend pulled up in his Jeep and i got in the car and then my boyfriend got out of the car and looked my ex in the eye then said a bunch of things to him, in an angry way, then got back in the car and drove off with me."
"My brother and I were in the car. We were heading somewhere that was time was sensitive. My brother was the driver. We were on the street by Cap Fed and Naismith Hall. He took a wrong turn and made a U-turn. He decided halfway through he didn't want to go anymore, so he took another u-turn. It pissed me off because I knew I was going to be late to wherever we were going. So I looked up and there was a giant clock and it was one of those digital clocks that showed you the number and it had read 6:30 on it. After realizing I was going to be late now, I threw the first punch, then he hit me back. We started fighting in the car and that's when I woke up. I remember waking up extremely pissed. The color of my dream was distorted. The sky wasn't blue and the grass was not green. But the floor was lava. Similar to Mario Kart's lava map. My point of view stayed in first person the entire dream."
"I remember I was in a house trying to find something. I'm not sure I what I was trying to find but the house was a peel apart house. So I was able to ""fly"" but not like easily. Think about it more as swimming. So I was peeling back walls and floors and different areas would apear like a jungle or another room. I peeled open the floor and inside was the ocean. I tried to close it but a shark was coming so I couldn't. Thats the most I remember."
"In my most recent memorable dream, my best friend started dating a boy that I cared about. It kept happening over and over again with multiple friends and other past romantic interests. I remember feeling betrayed and heartbroken that they would all do that to me. I even woke up at one point and when I fell back asleep I re-entered the dream."
The dream I had last night was a good dream I was the main character. We were at a drake concert and I got brought on stage and then basically fell in love with me and bought me a bunch of stuff that I wanted and it was pretty cool then he like left and some other guy i was trying to get to be in love with me showed up and my friend was stealing him and that was really annoying then i awoke.
"I was walking on the sidewalk of a street that resembled Massachusetts Street. It was dark outside and I was carrying my wallet, phone, and computer. I'm not sure where I was going. I was the actor in the dream. Someone came up from behind me and stole my wallet, phone, and computer and ran away before I could see who it was. At the same time a car drove by and it was my roommates/friends car and my roommate was it in. She was an Uber driver which is not true in real life. There were many people in her car and they were talking very loudly with the windows open. Then the person who stole my belongings got in the car, and my roommate drove away but didn't notice I was there. Then it started pouring rain and I somehow got to a high school cafeteria that I've never seen before and I'm not sure how I got there. From the outside the building looked like a large shed. It was really crowded and loud inside and I didn't recognize any of the people. I met my roommate there and told her what happened and she took me to the people that she had given an Uber to. We convinced the people to give me my belongings back and they did. I felt happy and that everything was fixed. Then, I turned on my phone and the entire memory was wiped and I wanted to text my mom what happened but I wasn't able to make texts or phone calls because it wasn't working. Then I started crying in my dream because I was scared, and then I opened my wallet and all of my cards and money were gone. My drivers license was not my real license and the back side of my license was black. However, my computer was fine and the memory was still there. After this my roommate and I went back to where we were living but it's not a place that I recognize from real life. I didn't see the outside but inside it had a very narrow spiral staircase up to two small separate bedrooms. There was a bed in my room and a large, wooden triangle in the corner that I'm not sure what it was for. I didn't know what to do and I felt alone ad like I couldn't get help. Then I woke up to my alarm."
"I don't remember the entire dream, but I was trying to write on my iPad and my Apple pencil was creating these deep scratch marks on the screen. It's a new iPad so I was very unsettled and I was trying to find a screen protector or something but it was completely ruined. I felt uneasy during this dream."
I was in my dorm room and I was a giant compared to all my roommates and all three of them were making fun of me. I was crying and my room was filling up in a pool. I remember looking at my hands and they were just huge and I was super self conscious.
"in my dream I was in my room hall kitchen sitting on the floor with my girlfriend and her entire immediate family. Including her older sisters boyfriend, their new born, and their two adopted brothers who no longer live with them. it was a first person point of view and the father said something that only I found funny. So after a couple seconds after he said it, I started laughing and everyone else started laughing. Also, I wondered if they knew who I was really laughing at. The dream made me feel good because it was my girlfriend‘s whole family and all in one place at the same time."
My girlfriend just got done visiting and she got back to her dorm yesterday and last night i had a dream that when she got back her roommate said she had mano so than I was very scared in the dream I was getting mano.
"I had a dream I was pregnant and it was from my own perspective. I remember feeling sick to my stomach and telling my friends and family. The dream was so vivid, I woke up sweating. My parents took the news well and were helpful and I was confused by their reaction. I mostly couldn't believe that I was pregnant and I was in shock."
I went to my friend's wedding and she is Indian so we all dressed in their cultural clothes and danced. Then I got my hair cut in a Walmart superstore and it was really bad. When I left I flew away. I remember being happy at the wedding and crying at the walmart because my haircut was bad.
"I was behind a gas station with a mechanics garage and Thanos was present and he was showing a goup of us the power stone and what it could do. I looked around and found a giant crystal that I was going to shape into my own power stone, I looked at my left hand and noticed that the mind and time stones were already enbedded in my gauntlet. I shaped the purple crystal into my own power stone and embedded it into the gauntlet. I then moved to the gas station and an emergency situation occurred. The part with the infinity stones i felt powerful, like i could handle anything. The gas station part made me anxious but in control and ready to act. The group I was with also shaped their own power stones but didn't know how to use them."
"A recent dream that I remember took me back to high school. It appeared to be the last day of my senior year and I was taking a test in calculus. Everyone in the class was struggling with the exam and we begged the teacher to give us more time. I'm pretty sure I did bad on that exam because he put stuff that we never learned. After the exam a few of my friends and I went around the school saying goodbye to teachers, and I remember saying goodbye to an old science teacher and crying. This dream made me think about how connected I was to the teachers at my old school and made me miss what I used to have. This dream was in first-person actor point of view as most my dreams are."
"I had a dream about my ex-boyfriend and I meeting to talk, since we just recently broke up. I remember wearing a black romper that he had bought for me for one of our anniversaries and I was wearing my checkered Vans. My hair was curly, his two dogs attacked me with kisses like they normally do and he had this longing look when he looked at me. I remember sweating at my palms and nervously playing with my hair, I tick which is very common. I was nervous, It had been a month since we broke up, and I had been struggling to sleep and eat. I hear a soft ""hi"" escape his mouth, something familiar. My heartbeat increased. His hair was longer and disarrayed and had dark circles under his eyes that matched my own. Petting his dog one more time, I say hi back and follow him to his room. The tension was hot, It was awkward and oddly comforting that neither of us knew what to do since we couldn't do the normal routine that we'd practiced for the past year and 3 months of being together. I wanted him. I wanted to feel the warmth of his hug and him fluffing my hair like he used to. But then the other part didn't want me to be there because I couldn't get the bare minimum. I was mad at him, mad at him for not planning dates, holding the door for me, or simply being present. I find myself walking towards him as he sat on his bed, I parted his legs with my own and engulfed him in a hug. I needed that hug and so did he. The smell of Old Spice body wash engulfed me as well. It was comforting, warm, and homey. He too engulfed himself in my fragrance. My Hypnotic Poison by Dior. One that he liked. I feel a warm wet streaking coming down my cheek. I was crying and so was he. I hated seeing him cry, I felt at fault. I felt like I was asking so much, but so little. His hands move from my hips to my upper back, I bend at the hip, looking directly into his eyes. He tilts his head, eyes closed and leans in for a kiss."
"I was dreaming about how my mom surprised me with a trip to Arizona for 10 days. I was a little upset because this was over break and I wanted to hangout with my friends while I was back in college. When I got to Arizona, my cousins and friends were also there. We randomly went to the beach (I know there's not one in Arizona) and hung out in the ocean for hours. We had a big party that night and celebrated something."
"a recent dream of mine was about my family surprising me with a vacation over spring break, but I wasn't that excited. They told me that we would be gone for 10 days, but I didn't want to be gone that long because I wanted to see my home town friends before I left again for college. Once I got to the vacation destination, all my cousins and friends were there awaiting my arrival. We had a huge party in the backyard because it had a pool and a big place to hangout and have a bonfire. I felt really happy after that and was glad they took me on the trip."
I had a dream that I was in Stars Hallow (a ficitional town in the show Gilmore Girls). It was fall and the leaves were falling as I took a sip of the coffee I had bought from Luke's diner. I was able to meet Lorelai Gilmore and the people of Stars Hallow. It felt surreal to be inside one of my favorite shows. The plot was just a normal day in the fall and I was able to experience the small town lifestyle firsthand. I felt happy and content.
"***btw, i meant to say yes I do have family members with sleep issues***
Last night, I was watching all of the actors and actresses walking down the red carpet preparing for the Oscars. I was with my girlfriend in my dream and was wondering why the Oscars was happening right now, as it's not yet March (by the way, my girlfriend and I are HUGE movie buffs and are gearing up for the oscars and it's a really big deal for us). I was fairly stressed out because I hadn't seen all the movies I wanted to see before the Oscars, and thought about how I should've prioritized specifically seeing Poor Things and Zone of Interest in theaters. I was beginning to feel my chest restrict and have trouble breathing as I kept watching the actors entering on the carpet and the flashing cameras taking pictures of them was becoming really overwhelming for me. My girlfriend was getting onto me for not having seen all the movies nominated for Best Picture at least. This was pretty much the entire dream. It was very short."
"I dreamed that there was a fire in my building, and me and my roommate helped a bunch of other people evacuate"
"I was in a nondescript theme park on a cloudy day by myself. I'm wandering around looking at attractions. I take a break on a bridge overlooking a river from a water ride when I hear a beautiful song being played on the piano. The song is ""Memories of Green"" from the movie Blade Runner. In real life this is a song that I'd been planning on learning. I trace the music to a tavern in the theme park. I step inside and it's very old timey themed and is lit only with candles. At the back of the bar I see an average height and weight white man with black hair playing the song on the piano. I start walking towards him and our gazes meet. He makes room for me on the piano bench and I watch him play. He finishes playing and tries to seduce and flirt with me. I refuse his advances but he's persistent. I run out of the bar and he continues to follow me around the theme park until I wake up."
"A recent dream that I had was about my best friend named Grace, her boyfriend was being unfaithful to her and she spent hours crying to me about it. I felt bad for her because I know how it feels for someone to betray you but I was also a bit annoyed, I don't exactly remember why. I don't know why or how but then it turned into me being in a relationship with a stranger, the reason why I remember this is because I was confused about how a stranger appeared to be my lover in my dream. I don't remember or recall seeing him in person but somehow he appeared to be in my dream."
In my dream I was going to my friends dorm room to hang out. I remember seeing two of my friends when I arrived. I arrived at the dorm but it wasn't like any other KU dorm. I entered through a window and it seemed like the floor and walls were tile. there was also a table without chairs around it and a very bland kitchen.
"I was in a cabin celebrating the Fourth of July with my husband and kids, it was nighttime and we were packing up to leave and go back home. It was kind of stressful at first trying to round up the three kids but I had my husband help so it was easier. It was more of a chilly night and there were a lot of mosquitos everywhere. They were all coming from the lake, so I went down before we left to set some traps but then they all flew towards me and started biting me, and then I fell to the ground unconscious. I woke up in the hospital with my whole family surrounding me I felt a burning sensation all over and that's when I got scared and woke up."
"I remember sitting with a group of people and my girlfriend was there with me and we were all sitting in a circle on a sidewalk and there was a random man that took my girlfriend away from me and went down the sidewalk, I remembered feeling scared and almost if my blood was rushing through me as it made me mad because I did not know what was happening and I woke up in a burst and was breathing very hard as I woke up."
"I am a cheerleader and there have been numerous times that I have had what I call a cheer nightmare. In the most recent one, I was late getting ready for a football game, came to the game in the wrong uniform and got in trouble. In the dream, I remember being very stressed and rushing to get ready. Once I got in trouble I remember feeling scared and upset that I wore the wrong thing, was late, and got in trouble."
"I was in the forest alone. I remembered it smelled like it just rained. I started to walk towards a cabin. It was a very modern cabin, very well taken care of, however, it was abandoned. I could hear birds chirping and I was surrounded by animals. I only remember seeing a dog, a snake, and some reindeer. I go into the cabin and find hot chocolate and the a fire. I sit down and close my eyes. I open them and see my mom and dad looking at me. I hug them and tell them to drink some hot chocolate. I felt calm and happy in this dream."
"I was taking the bus home, but it was in a different city. I wasn't alarmed or confused or anything, I just thought it was normal. I was on the right side of the bus and there was a couple next to me on the left side of the bus--the orientation of the bus was like a plane. Then, I switched to the left side where the couple was and had my hand out of the window. I almost got it cut off by a wall that was super close but I pulled it back just in time, I didn't feel scared, I felt exhilerated. I then was dropped off somewhere unfamiliar and super open in the city, but I still didn't feel confused. A group of guys were walking toward me and they looked hostile so I ran away and eventually went into a house that only had stairs going towards the attic. It ended up being a brothel with four women (I know that's not appropriate!!), and my dream ended there (I'm going to end it there) I realized I was in the dream once I ran up those stairs."
I was coming home and walked in on my boyfriend cheating on me with this girl I hate.
"I had a dream recently where I was with my siblings, but we saw something out of the window and it was movie characters, but from horror movies, such as Chucky, the exorcist, etc.. this wasn't too uncommon because ive feared these characters my whole life, my dream jumped to us riding in a car, bu these characters running so fast, almost as fast as the car itself. I remember tasting air, and feeling breathless, this wa also Timelapse on my street where I grew up at, but moved away in middle school. I was scared in the dream and everything felt unpredictable."
"It was a few nights ago so I forgot a lot, but I was at my house with my best friend Ella and we were dancing to songs and then kpop singers we like were there and they were very impressed by our dancing. Ella and one of the singers danced to one of his songs and then me and the other singer danced to his song and it was all lighthearted and happy. we were dancing on top of the stairs though which was weird. I was viewing it from a movie point of view, mostly always third person."
"I remeber being in my dorm and I saw that my roomate had bought toilet paper, which in the past few months, I have been the only one on our side of the dorm to provide. This made me really happy, as I didn't have to provide more and go spend my money to get some for the both of us as it was something we both needed to share."
I had a dream in third person view of me flying in this infinite cube like place where everything was this blue/grey color and in the area I was in was this structure that looked like it was made from different sized cubes. It looked like the worlds in Super Mario Bros 3D Land. I was flying but also being chased by a villian. The way I was able to fly kinda felt like what you. have to do when you're under water swimming. I tried to fly faster to get away from the villian chasing me but I just couldn't.
"I walked into a room. It was very dimly lit with a florescent (inconsistent) flickering light, and a girl named Auri was laying there in the middle back wrapped up in a blue quilted blanket on a hospital bed. She's pale, with lash extensions and red/brown hair with blonde highlights. She has a nose piercing. Her left leg was gone. There was a monitor next to her and some black screens on the left side of the wall, but that was it. Her eyes were closed and she was breathing through the ventilator/monitor. The floor was just beige colored tiles, and the room was grey. In real life, Auri was a friend/coworker of mine, but I never had really strong emotions for her until the dream. I was very very very sad she was in the hospital bed, almost as sad as I was when a loved one of mine died. In the dream, I knew that she was going to die. I was never touchy-feely with her in real life, but in my dream I crouched on a red stool next to her and held her hand and touched her forehead and cried while she slept. Then she woke up and chuckled a little bit and asked why I was crying. I told her she was going to die, and she ""no I'm not, I'm fine."" I looked down again and her leg was back and bundled up with the rest of her in her blue blanket. We end up just talking, I don't remember what about, but the conversation is casual and any hesitancy I had towards her in real life was completely gone. A window casually appears on the right side (the East side) of us, and I watch outside. It's dark, and there's a busy road/intersection (the room/hospital is at the corner of the intersection) with bustling cars and all their lights going. The nearby buildings also had lots of lights. It was raining slightly. The road we could see best (going from the North to the South) was inclined, with several little bumps/rolls, with the highest point toward the North side. The cars (normal ones you'd see anywhere) continued to get faster and faster, and we watched as some of them went so fast that they just flew over parts of the hill. I said ""they are starting to get pretty fast."" Some of them begin to drive out of control, as the ones that were flying would land on top of other cars, but the dream acted as if it was normal. Slightly alarming, but normal. More and more cars began to crash, when suddenly cars just began to get launched over from the top of the hill (we couldn't see why they were launching to such a degree). We heard a roar, and suddenly fucking King-Kong appears at the top of the hill and is sweeping cars off the road with his hands and sending them flying. Another giant monster is next to him, but I can't remember what it looked like. I remember starting to feel fear as one of the cars hit out building but didn't break it. We watch King Kong start to descend down the hill, throwing cars everywhere, and realize he's coming towards our building. More cars start hitting our building, when Auri jumps up and grabs my hand at the same time. She's in a white hospital gown with blue and pink mini stars. ""Run!!!"" she shouts, and just as we start to sprint towards what I'm assuming is a door, a car that King-Kong threw hits our room and the ceiling comes crashing in and my dream ends."
"I was in bed next to my mom and was really anxious because she was dying and she was like doing the typical movie deathbed advice stuff. Then out of nowhere Miranda Bailey (from Grey's Anatomy) got on the bed and like shot her. I didn't see blood or anything and there weren't like bullets, but I understood that Bailey had killed her and then Bailey came for me, but I managed to get the gun from her and shoot her instead (still no blood or gore, just like the concept that she was dead as well)."
"I had a dream that I went back to my high school as a college student to take a physics class. The teacher was my old high school physics teacher. I had to leave class early for a track meet because I’m on the KU track and field team, but when I told my teacher I had to leave he became very upset and disappointed in me. As I left he told me I might as well not come back and that hurt me because I had really liked him and he seemed to not like me at all anymore. As I left the building it started pouring rain and I ran to my car. As I pulled out of the parking lot, the yeti from GTA 5 began quickly running down the road chasing me. I started to panic because I’m not good at driving in gta but if I let the yeti catch me he would kill me so I started driving really fast. I struggled to control the steering wheel and accidentally hit a pedestrian walking on the side walk. I immediately heard police sirens coming to get me, However I was still running from the yeti. Eventually the police stopped my car and the yeti caught up to me. During the whole chase I was feeling extremely anxious but as the yeti went in for a punch I felt mortified. Right when he made contact with me in my dream, I woke up in real life gasping. It was 4am, and I had the feeling I get in my stomach when I’m supper nervous and I had tears in the corners of my eyes. I feel like this dream was very silly but I was genuinely terrified."
I went on a vacation with my friends. I was having fun and we were heading to the airport.
