I was having my final night shift at work i asked oncoming shift if they minded I go get some coffee at a shop down the road before we handed over. I went to get coffee, taking about fifteen minutes to walk there—it was a doctor’s clinic, it was by the banks of a river, and all the people around seemed to be engaging in recreation activities, enjoying themselves in boats, having picnics etc. The river stopped at the doctor’s surgery though. There were bluestone-cobbled pavement and street at the end of the river, and I wondered whether the river went underground at this point. I thought I would have to look it up on google maps.  I went into the doctor’s and I sat in the waiting room watching something on television about rainforests. I rang my doctor explaining that I had an appointment with them at 3pm that same day, but could I come for appointment now because I had to see someone this morning, and something about not wanting to pass something on to them if I was infected. I was stuttering and embarrassed on the phone, was lying about something. the doctor couldn’t change my appointment. I went to leave, the nurse on reception wanted to take my blood pressure. I asked if it was too late to change my coffee order to a double shot, no it was ok, they said. For some reason they had touched the blood pressure cuff with a swab that had been used to collect my faeces sample. The cuff was made of material I had been using to make face masks I asked whether they shouldn’t sterilise the cuff, no, they said, it was ok. the nurse said my blood pressure was 100 and i thought, that is very low. They asked what I thought of the tv show in the waiting room. They didn’t ask for payment or medicare details and said i could leave, I thought this was strange.

I started getting angry at them. The issue turned into something involving another man, who was there as well. It involved calling someone, maybe this person, a ‘bastard’. Everyone was laughing at me, they said ‘that’s impossible, because this man is his father’. I was embarrassed for not knowing, but still angry because they were missing the point.

These rooms are old, made of stone, there are doorways but no doors, and there is no glass in the windows. I think it is somewhere in Italy.

I called up the office and pretended to be a client to obtain the information. I was surprised they couldn't detect it was me and they politely obliged, providing the details we needed.  The art piece seminar and judging was already underway and we still had to submit our pieces. I wanted to improve our chances by including the new information and preparing new toast and jam. I spoke to my colleague for her input - do we have time for me to do this? What did she want me to do? She didn't respond and was anxious about the seminar. It was at the bottom of the football stand, which now had a room full of seated people in theatre style. You could hear someone giving a talk.  I went to a kitchen bench at the bottom of the football stand and started to prepare toast. My colleague approached and was seemingly going to submit the untoasted pieces we had prepared earlier.   I saw another colleague from yet another place I used to work at and asked for his input. He was on the judging panel. He responded in a slow drawl like he had an acquired brain injury. I wasn't sure if he was drunk and wondered what had happened to him.  In trying to recreate the pieces, it looked at our bottles of jam and saw one was missing. However, the lids had been put on the wrong jars. There was a chance there was enough of the correct jam in one of the lids to complete our submission.  I left it up to my colleague as to what she preferred to do.",460,2,2,0,2,2,30-aug.-20,0,53,1,1,0,2,5,2,3,4,3,4,3,5,1,31,84,36,20,103,2.8,2.86,6,3,1.96,28.97,1.09,0.43,0.87,0.22,0.22,0.22,0,0,0.96,0.96,18.7,10,0.51,0.51,16.3,12.39,3.91,0.73,0.74,DD_Report_pruned,1,6.09,2.39,0.22,2.83,0.87,17.39,13.48,0.65,1.52

112,20,0,,,9/13/20 1:16,13.09.2020,700,"I was preparing to go camping with my family. We had a couple of vehicles and I was asked to drive a 4WD campervan/caravan.  A friend of mine somehow ended up at my father's house and we invited him along.  The vehicles were already packed with supplies. I had only to pack my own bag. It was taking me ages to do this and I wasn't really focussed. I looked at my drawers and decided there was little point taking my snorkelling gear as it was too cold and I rarely used it whenever I'd taken it before.   It was getting late and I had still to complete my packing. My friend was already in bed in the same room I was doing the packing. I grabbed a first aid kit, underwear and socks. I was longing to be in bed with my friend instead. We were both exhausted and had to get up early in the morning.  I started bleeding period-like and went to the bathroom to clean up. My friend came in to see if I was OK.  I finally went to bed, hoping my friend would snuggle up to me. He didn't.  The dream then changed.  We were in a few tents although it was really a house with several rooms made from tent material. It may have been at my father's former home.  I could see in the distance there was a rampaging moose on fire. He was heading our way and I was trying to alert the others of imminent danger. I can't recall if I was successful.  The dream then changed again.  We were being pursued by authorities for a breach of some kind. My friend was talking to them and then gave them the slip.  My sister and I were trying to get away as well as catch up with my friend. There was a feeling that he had been in trouble with authorities before and was a bit of a smart Aleck. My sister and I hopped over several people's backyards like hop scotch and ended up near a long line of high power lines. It was drizzling.  We looked to the right along the power lines to see if we could see my friend. We couldn't. We were trying to decide whether or not to swing from these to hasten our escape.",392,4,2,0,2,3,30-aug.-20,0,53,1,1,0,2,5,2,3,4,3,4,3,5,1,31,84,36,20,103,2.8,2.86,6,3,2.3,23.45,1.28,1.02,0.51,0.26,0.26,0,0,0,0.98,0.98,21.17,11.48,0.3,0.3,17.35,14.29,3.06,0.64,0.64,DD_Report_pruned,1,9.95,2.81,0,1.02,0.51,16.58,14.29,0.26,1.28
112,21,0,,,9/4/20 1:18,04.09.2020,640,"I was travelling by bus with a group of people and we stopped at a tourism spot. I was by myself and watched others looking through craft shops and decided to go the bathroom before we recommenced our journey. It then changed that we had been camping there as I emerged from my tent to walk to the bathroom. I passed someone from the bus on the way to the bathroom, possibly someone I know from choir. When I came out of the toilet block I could see people walking back to the bus and followed them as I wasn't entirely sure of the route back to the bus and where it was parked. I climbed an embankment and when I reached the top I couldn't see the people to follow any longer and was unsure which way to go. Rather than get lost going back down, I decided to continue to the bitumen road but couldn't see the bus. I assumed the bus had left without me as I had been angrily warned it would not wait, like I had kept it waiting previously. I was then in the back seat of an older car. There was a couple in the front and I had hitchhiked a ride with them, unsure where they were going. The man was driving. His female partner a passenger. They told me they were going to Newstead and they would take me as far as there. I was heading to Launceston where I worked. I didn't have any contact details on me and wanted to let my work know where I was. I asked the people in the car what the number of the tour company was and they recited the number but every time I tried to put the numbers in I did it incorrectly. I tried to call my sister so she could pass on a message but the same thing happened; I couldn't complete the sequence correctly. The same when I tried to leave a message on my father's answering machine. I had my large backpack in the back seat with me and I kept checking it to make sure my belongings were inside. Next thing all was quiet and I wasn't sure if we had stopped and I had been asleep.The couple had gone and the windows were foggy. I then recalled the driver saying there had been a change of plan, they were letting me out here. I didn't know where I was. It seems the car had been stolen. A group of criminals were looking for the couple and were approaching the unfogged car to search for money the couple had stolen from them. I was concerned they would think I was involved and grab me but I managed to slipped out one door as they opened another and started to look inside. I had the money. It was in foreign currency. I found an abandoned house. I had a shotgun for protection and drew curtains so I could remain undetected although they didn't completely close or stop people seeing inside. Outside a group of people drove along with a dog and guns, firing into the bush. The leader was a woman. I was concerned I would be found. I wasn't sure if they knew I was there somewhere and were searching. They were annoyed as there was a bus full of hippies there, also with guns. A confrontation took place and the brightly coloured bus was pushed over with many hippies still inside. A couple of people still had their thonged feet hanging outside the side of the bus. Others had their arms hanging outside where windows would normally be. I was relieved the group in the car weren't looking for me after all. At some point, someone approached the house where I was and came inside. It was the owner. He looked a little like a friend of mine who is a little hippyish. At times I was him, others I wasn't. We needed to leave because of impending danger. Time passed and I had been trying to make my way to Launceston. I was in a different house and place now. Still with the hippy guy. Now I was an observer. The hippy guy was talking to someone and went to his house. When he came inside, he was talking to someone who wasn't there. It was a ghost he could see as a version of himself, unshaven and younger. When they came to a mirror, the hippy couldn't see the person in the reflection. However, the ghost could see the image of themselves at the time of their death. The ghost was shocked to see it was the leader of the criminal gang. He was trying to find out who killed him so he could take retribution. . The hippy came in again, like he was seeing himself repeat a sequence from the past so he was there in 3 different time periods. The second time the ghost looked in the mirror, it was a different ghost who was also shocked at the reveal of who he was. Next thing we were in a room full of people. The criminal ghost was there chatting to people pleasantly. He seemed to be more kind and genuine in his interaction but still secretly trying to find out who killed him. It was the fault of the hippy guy, yet he hadn't done it. Once again, the hippy guy was sometimes himself, sometimes me. Next thing, the atmosphere changed and we were all prevented from leaving. We were handcuffed/hands tied behind our back and were about to be interrogated. The hippy guy gave a woman there a knowing nod and he created a distraction of smoke, explosion and light like a firework so he could quickly unlock the door to escape. He threw his bag and went after it. But the woman was slow to react and they were caught. Next thing I know there was a celebration of sorts as a couple of people from my work were in the room. They had driven down from Launceston to retrieve me. I was to go home to Hobart with them. I was relieved to see them. I was in a chair leaning on someone from work. I'd fallen asleep. They rose when I awoke and moved elsewhere. They were uncomfortable that I sweated in my sleep on them. People from work were around, chatting and catching up. They assured me I had a reserved spaced on the trip back to Hobart. Before we left, I assisted with throwing out items into a skip. Some of it was film showing evidence of the murder. A policeman was there combing the debris but didn't see it. There was also some jewellery in a box that was found. I spoke to the person who found it and said I knew the person whom that was stolen from, a family friend. He offered to give it to me back but wanted to keep a ring and some other item for himself. I agreed and said the owner would be pleased to have it back. I threw some items out into a boat that was next to the skip. People from work, who use the boat, were geared up and I realised they weren't milling about with the clean up but getting ready for field work. Despite this, I kept throwing obsolete items in there so they would be mixed up with workable ones. I made some cheeky comment to one of the guys there. It was time to depart so I looked for my seat on the coach which looked like business class aircraft cabin. My things weren't there but others already seated handed them to me.",1297,2,3,0,2,#NULL!,30-aug.-20,0,53,1,1,0,2,5,2,3,4,3,4,3,5,1,31,84,36,20,103,2.8,2.86,6,3,2.16,16.7,0.77,1.08,0.85,0.23,0.31,0,0.23,0,0.98,0.98,20.66,10.79,0.42,0.42,16.89,13.26,3.62,0.7,0.7,DD_Report_pruned,1,7.32,0.85,0,2.08,2.31,14.8,14.88,0.39,0.93
112,12,0,,,9/2/20 1:13,02.09.2020,650,"I was about to go on an overseas holiday and a friend of mine gave me a large spray bottle with alcohol and lemonade or similar in it. She said it would be useful for both a drink and sanitiser against COVID-19.  Next thing I was on a public bus with two different friends I lived in London with. I showed them the bottle and they sampled it. One I sprayed directly into the mouth, the other on her hand. I said it was strong as I immediately felt warmer as the contents slid down my throat to my stomach. They weren't travelling with me.  I led a group of people I knew to a dorm of sorts which didn't have beds, just carpeted space. As we were the first, we had the choice of where we wanted to set up our things before others arrived. There were workshops/activities scheduled, the reason we had chosen to come here. Despite being early, out the window we could see that the activities had already started. We hadn't yet decided which ones to go to and we were toying with exploring outside instead. It was Singapore and the temperature was pleasant. I recalled to a couple of my friends that I had been to Singapore before but didn't venture outside as I had decided to sleep in between flights. We had a 12 hr stopover between Australia and New Dehli. My friends had been to Singapore before but were keen to revisit some places. They weren't oppressed by the heat like I had been.  We were in no rush. Some of us read. We lounged about on our sleeping bags on the floor.  The room now seemed to be part of my father's former house.  I was expecting others to join us and warned the others that there may be others coming that were a little, I can't recall exactly what, but they were OK. I opened the door to look outside but there was no one there. I thought I'd leave the porch light on as my father wasn't yet home despite it being late. Then my sister said he was in his bedroom as he wasn't well. He had been there the whole time and I hadn't realised. I was sorry to hear he was sick and was relieved we hadn't woken him. Although he was awake now from me fiddling with the door and light. A friend of my father's I didn't like was due to arrive.  The room switched back to the dorm as before, this time with a deadlocked door. There was an impatient bang on the door at 8am as others arrived, a couple of whom were known to me. This implied that we had been in the dorm overnight. They commenced filling the remaining spaces. The room was open plan with lots of little alcoves like the doors/walls of a house had been removed. These people were not one group but several so they dispersed in different directions.  Through the curtained window, I could see a silhouette. It knocked. I pushed back the curtain and a man of about 30 beckoned me to open the sliding window. He was fairly attractive. I did so and he wanted to know if he could come in. He was looking for someone. Before I could answer his question, he had started to climb inside and next thing was standing next to the window on the inside. I was annoyed and said he could go back out the way he came in. He obliged.   I decided to explore the premises. I think I was looking for someone, possibly the person the man mentioned. I found myself in a room of writhing, interconnected naked bodies. They were silently exploring sensuality without kissing. I stepped over bodies and a friend of mine walked past and wondered if I would like to join? I said no, it wasn't my scene and left her to it. She wasn't part of the writhing mass and was fully clothed but about to partake.  I recalled the scene to someone upon returning to my group and likened it to the statues in a sculpture park in Oslo.  The scene changed again and I was eating a meal with others, including my sister and 12 year old nephew, at a table in a kitchen, presumably at the dorm. There was some behaviour that had incensed my nephew who is a born again Christian. He angrily denounced the behaviour, thanking the host for the meal they had prepared for him and stormed off. I followed him, impressed that despite the difference in attitude, he could still be respectful and thankful.  We were walking along a road to my father's former home, which was really a plank of wood so when we came to the end, it swiveled over so we could walk along the other side. There were items on it I can't recall.",827,3,2,0,3,4,30-aug.-20,0,53,1,1,0,2,5,2,3,4,3,4,3,5,1,31,84,36,20,103,2.8,2.86,6,3,3.63,33.77,2.3,1.33,1.09,0.48,0.6,0.12,0.36,0,0.96,0.96,18.86,10.88,0.47,0.47,18.26,13.54,4.72,0.72,0.72,DD_Report_pruned,1,7.01,2.3,0,2.9,1.09,16.44,13.91,0.6,0.97

We were going through new clothing in the cupboards. She was there. At times she would go off searching and find items she thought appropriate to give to us. This was generous of her although the atmosphere was tense as we thought we would soon be rumbled. We discovered two human fetuses and decided to rear them by removing them from where we found them. I kept one warm by putting it under the top of my track pants. At one point we had a Stanley knife to protect ourselves from the woman. She nearly detected it once but we managed to hide it among the clothes and retrieve it later. I cut myself in the process. It then changed and I was in KMart with my sister. She was trying to find clothing or something. We were also trying to restore our damaged relationship. I lost my sister in the maze of clothing and other shelves of goods. I heard a commotion of my sister being mocked and went to see what was happening. She was being followed and taunted by a group of former peers, all women, as she tried to leave them. It had something to do with the fetus. This changed to a corridor of what looked like an airport terminal. There was an unsavoury looking man pursuing my sister, also taunting her. I approached him as a distraction, saying I had heard that another woman was interested in him. He stopped, suspicious. He asked how to spell this person's name, implying it was mine. He then declared he wasn't interested. By this time, my sister had disappeared and there was no danger to her or the fetus. This then changed to a fellow from work who knew about the fetuses and clothing. We were on a bushwalking trail with others travelling single file. He was way behind me. I asked him not to say anything some time ago but he had changed his mind. He was telling others on the trail and it was only a matter of time before it got back to the woman up the front of the trail. He tried to race ahead of me to tell others. He wanted to reveal the truth to protect members of his team. This changed again and another man, some sort of senior management figure, was looking for the fellow from work. He opened the door to a staff/class room, interrupting the lesson and asking about the fetuses. The fellow from work and his partner quickly tried to diffuse the situation and hurried him out of the room. I found my sister in a room and wondered how she was going with the fetus. Someone else there was looking for them. I can't remember if this was sinister or not. It appeared she had neglected the fetus and it had dried out a little. She attended to it and I gave her the fetus I had so they were reunited again. My nephew was there, doing homework on computer. Then the dream changed to one of imminent disaster in the form of an industrial accident. The fellow from work worded up his team in one work place, to move to another. The second place caught on fire, burning to the ground. The fellow from work escaped the blaze but it appeared to the authorities he had died in the fire.

113,31,0,,,9/5/20 7:01,05.09.2020,530,"I was being productive in some way as if researching, maybe to do with food and feeling rested in my involvement. It was a search of some sort. It was involving and clear. Then I was with Dad, Ken, Alison and others. We were all talking with humour and interest. Someone joked along the lines that I would require a partner with high food standards. Ken offered that he can cook a bit. I was on the ground on my back laughing uncontrollably with joy. I didn’t feel separate from others with my laughter, even though it was such a bodily experience. The others carried on and I felt included in the group. Dad stood with his hands in his pockets and smiled in a genial way in my direction and at the others. I was crossing some paddocks with Alison. They had rounded rises and again the grass tending towards brown, a bit tangled here and there. The environment had a slight abandoned or forgotten quality. Outdoors, open and unattended, somewhere kids might find interesting, but not traversed frequently by adults. Alison had a purpose, I knew what it was In her interested and anxiety-free way she pondered and kept moving and talked leaving lots of silences. I didn’t fill the spaces, I felt like I was learning from her, or she was a guide of sorts or simply it was more her mission than mine. Nor was I being silent. This felt natural, perhaps as it would have in my late teens when there was a more apparent age difference or because I was searching the environment and talking was secondary. I wondered if Alison would like some tuber roses I knew she would have to take the train back to Sale before long. Then it occurred to me that I could buy them and surprise her with them. I would have to find a florist. I found a florist who reminded me of part of the Brunswick St cool scene in the 80s. She seemed too analytical to be selling flowers. I asked if the flowers would last. She said they probably wouldn’t make the journey.

I have remembered about six lines and I like the sound of them.   On the same piece of paper are some chords to a favourite song. Below that the words of the song I have hand written. I look at the chords, wondering who wrote them for me, because I wouldn’t know them myself. It is only one line of chords and as I look at them I very slowly realise they are not chords, but some other symbols, like Chinese characters. It takes me a while to realise they aren’t that either, but I can’t place them. They are complex with too many lines to be chords or alphabet characters. They look familiar though, like a franking stamp but finer.   It is late and I should be asleep. I am in bed with my brother Jim. I can hear someone in other rooms or outside beyond. The light is on. I also want whoever is out there, maybe Harry (younger brother), to think we are asleep and I get out of bed to switch out the light. I write, or the writing is on the wall ‘switch out the light’. I press my hand like a cursor after light and wonder why the light isn’t responding then realise you switch it off by pressing the light switch. I think the switch is white but it is an older one like the baker light switches with an obvious up down quality.  In the dark I hop back into bed and my foot lands on Jim’s body.

113,32,0,,,9/9/20 1:20,09.09.2020,630,"I was sitting at a rectangular dining table opposite a woman. The circumstance had a mixture of formality and the informality of a communal setting like a school camp or spiritual retreat. The woman wore a white scarf. It was tied with a simple large bow at the neck. It was the type children wore as embellishment in the early 20th century and it became her. I don’t remember our conversation, yet I was focused on her and felt a general companionship towards her.  A servant in Victorian livery entered and with professional flourish yet ineptly ripped the scarf from her neck, tightening it as he did so. I could see it unfolding and I cried out to the servant to stop, it is not a serviette. I felt for the woman, her possible embarrassment that her dress was taken as a napkin, and she didn’t seem to be able to defend herself and was clutching her neck in alarm. So I was the person taking action, and I mainly directed myself to her, checking she was okay and recovering her scarf.   The woman settled back and attended to composing herself. Now I was aware of the man beside me and I leaned into him. The more I leaned the better I felt to just feel warmth and someone next to me. He offered no resistance and we simply sat closely side by side in quiet connection. We continued to talk gently with a companionable quality between three of us. I didn’t know the man, or the woman, although I felt connected to the woman simply by the concern I had felt for her. I couldn't detect much of her attitude to me. I felt close to him simply by my own desire to be next to him. Although I couldn't read his feelings either. It was dawning on me, that the two of them were a couple. I wondered if I should extricate myself from him.  He was up preparing the next meal at the stove. I noticed him taking two large fresh carrots and some broccoli from my supplies to add to his chicken and assortment of food. I nodded it was okay and offered to contribute more. I looked for grains and only found a third of a packet of Sunwhite short grain rice with a rubber band around it. I seemed to be pulling it out of some occasionally used camping supplies at the bottom of a small tin storage box and felt embarrassed at such a dismal offering. The makeshift quality of our separate food supplies also struck me. Mine were scattered between different bench tops. Yet he was happily cooking appealing fresh food. I made excuses for the rice, saying I only use it for sushi. He declined the offer casually saying there was plenty of food.   I walked out to look at the kitchen garden. I was going down narrow paths in the underbrush. Gaye and others were there. I felt like getting some bearings. I found an old leather wallet with a few coins in it. Now I was clambering in a sinking sand pit and I put the wallet on a wooden structure, wondering whether to leave it there or hand it in. I continued back to the house taking the wallet.   A young boy sidled up to me saying he could hear coins. I put him off and decided to hand it in rather than give it to him.",579,4,2,0,2,2,30-aug.-20,0,62,1,1,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,3,1,9,49,35,24,80,2,2.29,4,5,2.59,34.85,1.73,0.69,0.86,0,0.69,0,0,0.35,0.9,0.9,15.37,5.87,0.44,0.44,17.44,13.99,3.45,0.67,0.67,DD_Report_pruned,1,7.77,0.86,0,5.18,0.17,15.54,9.5,1.04,0.35
113,30,0,,,9/6/20 4:06,06.09.2020,700,"Dad and I pulled over in a Hobart street. We were both out of the 1940s car and I found Trace. We swiftly got back in the car, dad and Trace in the back. I hopped into front passenger seat being dishevelled from the urgency of finding T. We had to get Trace to airport. I am not sure if that included me. Being in an urgent hurry I started driving from the front passenger seat then realised how difficult it was to change position. Due to speed and awkwardness I missed empty street spaces to pull in and swap seats. Before I knew it I had to turn a wide arc left into Davey St to take me to airport In mid turn I decided that I must pull over and get into driver seat and I swerved straight ahead to an inclined ramp, taking me up adjacent to the docks. Approaching the ramp, and due to speed, now on the left, I was taken with an extraordinary sight. Two narrow Antarctic ships at the front edge of the docks. There was nowhere safe to pull in and look at them. They were both stationary and yet on a 45 degree lean as if caught in a storm at sea, with high waves between them. There were also sunset colours in slivers, and the cool blue of ice from whence they had come in their immediate vicinity. However this stunning visual that appeared active without any pose of danger was singular to these two ships alone. Apart from wanting to investigate myself, I was keenly aware of a missed opportunity for dad with his deep interest in physics and meteorology. I continued driving the car up and around another broad sweep into a street where I could pull in to the kerb. I had to go to the toilet and raced into a department store. I thought I knew where I was going, but got caught in a terrible web of different departments and staircases. At one stage I was dodging statues of almost life-size elephants in the theatre auditorium. I finally arrived at the very personal toilets, like the ladies at Georges. Not as gracious, but the discreet behaviour had the same feeling whilst the décor was more floral and down a rung or two. It was just about impossible getting back to the car. I didn’t know what street exit I should be heading for inside the department store. None of the stairs down led to anything familiar within the store. I kept going down different staircases and aisles in vain. I found myself in the less public part of the building and found Judy (Trace’s best friend at school) and others. Now Judy wanted my phone number. It was an impossible procedure trying to enter it on an outdated phone, plus I was sure quite unnecessary. By now I realised I had left my bag with all my rent money in the ladies, and there was still the airport to get to. I finally located the personal attendant in the ladies. She immediately presented me with another bag initially raising my hopes. It was quite eye catching in its own way, tasteful abstract floral with a structural form from another decade. I was struck by the coincidence of two handbags being left behind and disappointed at the thought of the money lost besides rent. Back on the street I looked for the car and dad and Trace. The streets seemed to give no clues as if scenery in a gangster movie I was surveying without luck.",600,4,4,0,2,#NULL!,30-aug.-20,0,62,1,1,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,3,1,9,49,35,24,80,2,2.29,4,5,2.67,22.3,1.33,1.17,0.67,0.17,0.33,0,0,0.17,0.91,0.91,15,5.5,0.19,0.19,12,8.67,3.33,0.55,0.55,DD_Report_pruned,1,7,0.5,0,0.33,0.83,18.67,9.33,1,1

Furthermore, it was generally well known so even more apparently, but not obviously provable. What should be easy wasn’t and so there was a lagging feeling of incompletion. This magnified and lacked boundaries when it was broadened to more people. Although they were known, and again appeared achievable, it turned into a repetitive sense of working on something and not getting anywhere. This was accompanied with a disturbing familiarity of something apparently achievable becoming a troubling inescapable mounting mass of the unattended as if under a microscope I couldn’t pull my eye away from. This was the uppermost feeling and the authorities were never visible or present and I woke up. Someone was being blamed unfairly. Feeling panicked I texted a message requesting an overnight stay at Chris and Gina’s as I walked along. The second I pressed send I regretted doing so.

One just being vacated raised hopes. A young man who looked trustworthy and relaxed claimed next in line.

One of them was assisting me. My fiancé accompanied me but waited in another room. I stripped down but was struggling to get my socks off. I kept losing my balance so needed help staying upright. I tried to get the dress on but was still finding it difficult to stand up. I kept tripping over the dress and was worried I’d rip the delicate lace. I felt very clumsy and was concerned that I’d be like this on my wedding day. I was trying to get up to look at myself in a mirror. I couldn’t stand up long enough to get a good look at it. Most of it looked good but there was aiming i could see that was way too small so I wanted to speak to the dressmaker about that. It’s important to note that the dress I saw in my dream is not the actual real life dress thatI have purchased but waiting to try on until lockdown finishes so I can go to my parents to try on since we had it delivered there. The housemates had just been listening to the news that coronavirus lockdown restrictions were going to be extended and the way out over the next few months was going to be worse than expected. This would really jeopardise the wedding. I was anxious but expecting that disappointing news. I kept trying to look at the dress but still couldn’t stop tripping over.

I felt slightly let down that they hadn’t closed the curtains to the room and prevented him from seeing the dress.

But the classroom space was actually like a supermarket with narrow aisles formed by shelves with products or books on them. The task at hand was some kind of coin tossing game. We were put into groups of 4 and I was in a group with my classmates D &G and someone else. The door at the back room was slamming in the wind and I was trying to stop it from doing so but not very successfully. My grade teacher Mrs V teacher told me off for being disruptive by making noise with the door. I told her off sharply in return that it was the wind, not me causing the noise. I remember the sense of being in a very bad mood. Then I was outside with my brothers and my mum was there too. The school was right next door to some top level military facility run by the Iranians. This was somewhat disconcerting. I said to someone if there's ever a war we will be the first ones to be killed.

On the other bed was an older lady whom I knew as a public defender. I had some business to be here but I was finishing up. There was a feeling of unease.

It was manually operated in some way, but I was explaining to my companion that it wasn’t a “paternoster elevator” because they run continuously, and passengers have to step in and out of the moving cage. This lift did stop at each floor, but had an elaborate mechanism where two operators were required to slide the cage sideways along metal tracks out of the lift well before the doors could be opened. My companion and I went looking for the toilets. We couldn’t find any in the ground floor, so we walked round the back of the building, where I’d seen a couple of doors that might have been entrances for ladies & gents, but they turned out to be very battered old wooden doors, locked and barred, which looked more like doors of storage areas, so we continued round and back into the building, where we heard an announcement that the lift was ready to take passengers upstairs (the mechanism being so slow and complex, and the cage so small, that passengers needed to book ahead to go up or downstairs.) My companion and I discussed whether we should take the opportunity to get onboard. I don’t know if we did. I was discussing whether something was real, or just something people said in dreams...

I was worried that he was taking advantage of us, and would deliberately choose the most expensive premium fuel, but when I went round to the other side of the car, following the very long hose from the car to the pump, I was pleased to see that he had actually chosen the cheapest appropriate fuel. When it came time to pay, I explained to my son that we needed to go in to the pay desk office/convenience store section.  We told the woman behind the desk the car’s registration number, which she entered on her keyboard and issued us with an invoice, which we took outside. My son wanted to go and pay cash to the man who poured the petrol, but I told him we needed to take the invoice to another cashier and pay by card. When we got to that desk, the transaction would not go through because I’d got two digits wrong in the car’s number, so we had to go back out, copy the number down correctly, take it back to the woman who issued the invoice and hope that she would agree to issue a new invoice with the correct number.

I had left my chair to do something and when I came back someone had taken my seat and there was nowhere for me to sit. I was upset and looked around me murmuring, “That was MY seat!” and while I was looking around somebody I vaguely knew moved a long table aside and a whole row of new seats seemed to appear from nowhere alongside it. I congratulated her on her problem-solving skills and sat down to chat with people I knew at the next table.  One of those people was Jeanette, who was standing nearby. I told her about the dream I’d had earlier last night about writing advertising in different musical keys. After that conversation I got up to either leave or go buy a drink, and thought for a moment that I’d lost my phone, but it had just slipped out of its cover, and I was holding it mixed up with a whole lot of other stuff.  I was coming back into a multi-storey apartment building I’d been into earlier, where someone had a grey kitten that looked like a baby version or our cat, except that this kitten was grey all over and didn’t have any of our cat’s white markings. I found the kitten sitting outside the building and picked it up and cuddled it, and it snuggled up to me, just like our cat used to do, and, even though I was disappointed that this cat’s markings weren’t as pretty, I really wanted to keep it, and was wondering if I could persuade my husband to welcome a new cat right away. The people in that apartment had a golden-type coated dog that had some kind of problem preventing it from eating, so they had some arrangement for feeding it.  I had a drink with a friend. Even though it was really early in the day, I joined her in drinking some kind of sticky, sweet liqueur, served in a pink bowl, with bits of fruit in it. My friend said she now wanted a cocktail, and insisted it would be easy to make. I hadn’t finished my drink, and as I was lying on the bed drinking it I realised it would be hard to sit up without spilling it, but I managed to twist around and hand the bowl to my husband, who was lying beside me. I followed my friend back to the kitchen, thinking she seemed to be a pretty big drinker. There was another woman in the kitchen. She was very neat, with an immaculate blonde pageboy haircut and a grey suit. I offered her a drink and she politely and rather primly said, “I hardly ever touch alcohol“ and then added, “except for my white wine in the evening”, in a tone of voice that suggested that the white wine was very important to her.  The cocktail woman was looking around for ingredients & saw a big plastic bottle of clear brown liquid on the bench. She asked what it was, and I told her it was vinegar - which was clearly written on the label.  At some point I was pouring some kind of lumpy grey breakfast cereal into a bowl. It was a strange sort of bowl, blue china, very deep and hollow-walled, with small holes either side, just below the inner edge of the rim.  As I poured the cereal in, it seemed to disappear somewhere, so the bowl always looked nearly empty. Then I bumped the side and bits started falling back into the bowl from one of the holes in the side, and I realised that the cereal had found its way into the hollow walls.

I did pour in the milk, but don’t remember drinking any.  I was helping my husband to vacuum pack some clothes. I didn’t get the plug in quick enough, so air started getting back in so he had to vacuum it again, and while he was doing that, I was fascinated by the complex bayonet-style locking device I noticed inside the plug.

A little later I see the car moving erratically, rolling backwards, driverless, and sort of ricocheting from one side of the road to the other. It needs to be stopped, and I do stop it, but there’s some sort of crime committed in the process. A little later I’m talking to the female driver about how to cover up the crime. We’re in a country lane and I’m leaning into the car window talking to her. I notice a man in the distance looking at us. He’s down the road, on the other side of a small wooden bridge, close enough to see us but not to hear. I warn the woman in the car that this man had seen us earlier,  and might link us to the crime. How do we eliminate him as a risk, without resorting to murder? I stroll across the bridge to chat with the man, acting nonchalant, and hoping to convince him that I’d run into the car woman by chance just now, and if he’d seen me with the woman earlier, it was a coincidence. I’m not sure how convincing an act I put on.

One of the men looked like Hugh Laurie in a pale blue-green tweed suit. He got a bit of poo on his suit. Nobody seemed embarrassed at all. I was at a nursing home visiting my grandmother. I was on the phone to my aunt about how Gran was going. Aunt was concerned that Gran wasn’t eating. I told Aunt that I’d seen Gran eating a sort of custard in the morning,and some omelette, and she’d had a few protein drinks, so she wasn’t starving & the nursing home people were looking after her ok. While I was on the phone Gran came into the room in a wheelchair. I didn’t want Gran to know I was talking about her, but hadn’t finished reporting back to my aunt, so I gave Gran a kiss and quickly and quietly told my aunt the rest of the news. Looking at Gran I noticed that even though she was so old and small, she still had the face of an intelligent and alert woman. I could see her younger self behind the wrinkles. I was at our children’s primary school and one of the teachers told me that “Mrs Troy” was on sick leave because she was having trouble with her ear, due to something she’d caught from one of the kids - possibly one of ours. I was meant to keep this information to myself & not spread it around. I was chatting to other parents in the school ground. The school was preparing for some sort of concert event where groups of children from each class were preparing presentations where they would talk about words starting with different letters of the alphabet. I was with my Dad, watching the presentations. A group of kids got up doing presentations about their set of letters - maybe D,E,F,G. A boy of about 10 took his turn, presenting his words with such style that I said to Dad, “I think I can see where he’s headed as an adult,” (imagining the boy as a stand-up comedian). I told Dad I recognised this boy - maybe I’d taught him - and tried to recall his name. I was pretty sure it was Daniel. I was in some concrete garage-like building with husband “B” and a big suitcase/backpack full of clothes on the ground beside a car. I needed a shower and went rummaging through the luggage to find a towel and shampoo. Then I started gathering clothes to wear. Realising that I was getting dressed for a performance of our Bolivian pan pipe band, I pulled out my poncho and a selection of black pants, top etc. to go under it.",463,2,2,0,4,4,31-aug.-20,0,64,1,1,0,4,5,4,5,5,4,5,3,4,1,30,78,31,22,98,3.2,3.14,4,2,1.94,20.23,0.86,0.86,0.65,0,0.43,0,0,0,0.96,0.96,18.14,8.21,0.41,0.41,15.55,12.74,2.81,0.68,0.69,DD_Report_pruned,1,7.56,1.08,0,3.67,0.43,15.55,10.58,0.43,0.65

We passed a street stall outside stocked with all kinds of beautifully packaged, interesting loaves, but it was closed and dark. The cake shop was open, but their display window was bare. I wasn’t sure if this was because they were stocking less stuff die to Covid, or if it was just late in the day & they’d sold out. There were lots of people in the shop, but people were trying to keep their distance.  At the counter I was served by a woman with a nice black & white polkadot mask. Admiring her mask, I realised I’d left mine at home. Worrying about being seen in public without a mask, I rummaged through my handbag for a substitute, and pulled out a long pink & orange handwoven scarf, which I tried to wrap around my face, but it kept slipping off. The shop woman’s mask also kept slipping below her nose. I asked if I could order a cake to pick up next Saturday, and she said, “Are you allowed to have people over for a party?” I explained that it would be just the 4 of us in our household who would be eating it, so she took my order.  At some point in this process I noticed that my husband had also forgotten his mask, so I had another look in my handbag and found a big square orange-toned shawl/scarf with fringes and flower embroidery. I offered it to my husband but he said he didn’t want it - that he had something else he could use, and dropped it on the floor.   I picked it up, feeling a bit disappointed, and saw it had dirty marks on it. I tried to fold it up neatly, but it was very big and hard to fold.

131,63,0,,,9/2/20 1:14,02.09.2020,220,"There was a music session & I was playing along with other people,  They were playing a tune that I thought at first was a folk tune, but turned out to be”Colonel Bogey” march. I did my best to join in though I couldn’t see the music properly. I was playing the flute and the others were playing all kinds of brass band instruments. Someone gave me some sheet music but it was for a different tune. Then they were playing a tune that was by some modern classical or jazz or something composer. It was a really nice tune that I’d been wanting or trying to play on the piano in the past and I was interested to hear how it sounded.  I was with B (husband) somewhere and remembered that he needed to move our car to somewhere safer because the parking time limit was running out and I didn’t want  to get a fine. I said I’d already parked our son’s car in a residential area where there were no limits. It was a long way back to where our car was, but we needed to move it.  Later on we were at someone’s house and I realised I’d left a musical instrument behind when we moved the car. I was relieved that I still had my flute with me. I could see the flute case was open and empty, but because I’d just been playing it, I knew it was ok.  At some point I was involved in acting in a movie. I was supposed to stand very still,  while some female character came up and made a speech in front of me. She was only knee high, so I leaned over to hear and sort of sobbed in sympathy with her pathetic words, wondering if it was ok to show any emotion in my standing-still role. Then there was a gunshot sound, like a starting pistol, and I started to run a lap round the room, but the director told me to stop, and asked why I always ran in these movies. I apologised and said I thought I’d been told to run when I heard the signal. I continued the run round the room, noticing bits of the polished floor that had been damaged. I was in a house with someone like Gerard and chatting about stuff, and then left to go next door, and he followed & rushed through the door ahead of me, gabbling some excuse to the people who lived there.",419,2,3,0,2,4,31-aug.-20,0,64,1,1,0,4,5,4,5,5,4,5,3,4,1,30,78,31,22,98,3.2,3.14,4,2,4.53,57.55,3.34,0.95,0.72,0,0.24,0,0,0.24,1,1,21.72,10.26,0.24,0.24,16.95,11.93,5.01,0.62,0.62,DD_Report_pruned,1,8.83,1.43,0,0.95,0.48,13.13,14.56,0,0.72
131,54,0,,,9/9/20 0:50,09.09.2020,630,"I was with people making a movie or a recording and noticed we were overlooking  an old folks home, and right in the middle of whatever we were recording a woman came into the yard repeatedly calling out someone’s name in a plaintive, shaky voice.    I was now somehow involved in relocating the old folks home into new premises. The residents weren’t all that happy with the move, and we were trying to convince them of the benefits. It had a pool in a sunny yard, & we got them to go in the pool - which at times looked only the size of a bathtub. We were trying to get them to agree how great that was, while uncomfortably aware that the yard was not all that big & looked out on a not very attractive street. Then a noise started. It sounded at first like a very loud rock band and then I worked out it was a Mr Whippy ice cream truck with its music too loud and distorted and I said to the people, it’s ok, that noise is just passing through. It won’t happen all the time.  Glimpse of making a cup of instant coffee, where the coffee powder was very fine, looking as if it had a little powdered milk mixed in. It was thinly scattered and partially sticking to the sides of the cup so I couldn’t work out if there was enough.  I was with a child who was in my care, possibly one of my students, and he/she needed some medication that had to be given “under parental supervision” or some rule like that. It was a clear liquid and I had to measure 4 spoonfuls of it as accurately as possible, but on the 4th spoonful the part where the bowl of the metal spoon met the handle went floppy, so the bowl of the spoon kept drooping down and spilling the contents. I tried all sorts of ways of holding the spoon in place with one hand while pouring the liquid with the other, realising that this was a job that really required 3 hands, and was calling out for help. The liquid was to go into a bathtub like the one the pool/ bath at the old folks home described above. The child was in the bath/pool, and I was telling her to “swim, swim”, miming the action as I said it.  I was with people in several vehicles driving fast along a dirt road. The vehicles, fairy rugged 4-wheel drives, kept either colliding head-on or having near misses because of one of the drivers unwittingly driving on the wrong side of the road. It was a very rough, dusty and stony road with poorly defined edges, and I heard a man’s voice saying that going so fast, “these things bounce around a lot”, implying that a driver could easily drift to the wrong side of the road without realising it.  At some point I was in a movie set where they were filming an episode of something where scantily clad women were reclining in what were meant to be glamorous poses. I think one of them was Essie Davis, playing Phryne Fisher, and I was looking at her, wondering how they make her look so much younger than she really is. Somebody explained that it was all about lighting, and tricks like oiling the skin so it looks shiny. For a moment I saw the women under bright, cool lighting, with pale, slack, slightly puffy, ageing skin, and then it switched to dim, warm light, and their skin glistening with oil, giving an illusion of youth.  I was getting dressed for a party “with my lovely aunt Beryl”. This Beryl was the sister of my Dad’s brother’s wife. While I dressed myself up in a pretty dress and lots of jewellery, Beryl appeared, dressed in some sort of satin tuxedo, because, after years of marriage & children she had come out as a lesbian, and wanted to wear masculine clothes.

Somebody asked me which notes I would use if I was buying things in the musical key of G. I said that the letters G, B and D would definitely be in the advertising because they’re the notes in the tonic chord & therefore very positive, and wondered if you would find notes from the relative minor anywhere in an ad. Would they use a minor chord to advertise something sad like a funeral director?

It’s meant to be 400g chicken breasts, but the package is all messed around and appears to have a lot of wings in it. That’s annoying, but I think I’ll just have to make do with wings. I’m now eating the meal, with a baby, about 6 months old, on my lap. The baby is interested in my food, and grabs a piece of pumpkin, biting a bit off one corner. It’s a bit hot and the baby spits it back onto the plate. I tell the baby, kindly, “It’s not nice to spit food from your mouth onto someone’s plate. It will get germs on it.” I’m looking at a sea scene on a TV screen, and keep noticing creatures. “Oh, look, a seal!” I reached out, through the screen somehow, to give the seal a cuddle. I knew it could be dangerous to get so close to a wild animal and risk a nasty bite, but the seal seemed to enjoy the cuddle & then went on its way. I’m at a ball. Dancing in a small room. Doesn’t seem to be anyone else there. I say, “Pity I’m not wearing a skirt,” thinking I’m wearing grey slacks, but then look down & see I’m wearing a calf-length skirt made of 3 or 4 tiers of fabric, each one with gathers where it attaches to the tier above so the whole skirt flares out when I spin around. Similar to a skirt I do own, but darker, in shades of reddish brown. I’m wearing the skirt as I walk down a street, maybe Lygon St in Carlton, & people somewhere behind me are talking derisively about hippy wannabe throwbacks wearing folksy skirts. I’m getting dressed opening a cupboard that has doors within doors, about 3 layers of doors covered with greenish wallpaper, & then shelves or drawers inside, and I’m wondering if I can take a shower right there, with water running all over the carpet or if I have to go to a bathroom to get changed. I’d really like to stop for a cappuccino, but I have to get to a meeting/get-together with some of my old work colleagues. First I have to find where I parked my car and then move it near the meeting place. I see a parking area, but the ground is covered in thick, red mud & I don’t want to walk there because it would mess up my shoes, so I follow the road further in & find a drier area with lots of parking spaces, so I decide to walk the shortest way back out to the street and park there. This involves climbing a very steep embankment & getting round the edge of some deep ditches to get back onto the footpath. I’m at the get-together, talking to my friends. I still haven’t had the coffee I wanted, but at the end of our meeting, “Ella”  hands us all plastic bags containing food we hadn’t finished from earlier. Mine had something chocolatey in it. As we were leaving, someone was talking about mental health issues related to Covid & suggesting that the virus caused changes in the brain, and I was trying to explain that the mental health problems were caused by anxiety about the virus, rather than through actually being infected, and that this was causing a lot of the problem in aged care. I went to find my car, which was now supposedly parked on the street a few doors away, but I couldn’t find it. I walked a block or two one way, remembering I needed to cover my face, pulling a scarf over my face while I felt in my pocket for a mask. Once I had my mask on & still hadn’t found the car I turned and came back up the middle of the street, through a kind of market area where I noticed that no-one else was wearing a mask. I was really angry and started saying louder and louder, “Where’s your mask?”, until finally I was standing in the middle of the street, shouting, “It’s because of selfish idiots like you that we’re stuck in this lockdown for longer and longer. Why can’t you be bothered doing a simple thing like wear a mask?!” And the people just looked at me with this “Who does she think she is?” kind of look. I got back to near where the meeting had been and still couldn’t find the car. I thought I could see a red Corolla like our real-life one, but when I got closer I could see it was a little dark red sporty thing. I felt a bit panicky, thinking our car had been stolen, or if I’d simply forgotten where I parked it, but then realised this was a dream & then I woke up.",810,3,4,0,3,#NULL!,31-aug.-20,0,64,1,1,0,4,5,4,5,5,4,5,3,4,1,30,78,31,22,98,3.2,3.14,4,2,2.1,17.37,0.86,1.11,0.74,0,0.62,0.25,0.25,0,0.63,0.63,20.74,8.89,0.16,0.16,14.44,9.88,4.57,0.4,0.4,DD_Report_pruned,1,8.15,0.86,0.49,0.25,0,15.31,5.8,4.07,1.23

B looked at me & said, “See - you CAN sing really well when you get a chance!” We were at a gathering, maybe some kind of concert in an upstairs room. We were sitting near the back on seats like wooden pews, and there were all sorts of clothes & other things scattered on the floor, including my handbag & iPad.

I said, “Make sure you get my iPad and the little notebook!” When we got home, or wherever it was we were staying, I looked at my handbag and realised that my iPad wasn’t there, and I was worried and angry with B who insisted he didn’t remember me saying anything about looking for the iPad. I replied angrily that the last thing I had said before he went back in was to make sure he looked for it, and why hadn’t he listened to me? He tried checking if it was nearby by making FB Messenger call to the iPad but we couldn’t hear it ringing, so we knew we’d left it behind. B said not to worry. We were the last people to leave that place, and we’d go back first thing in the morning, so the only people likely to have seen it would have been cleaning staff or organisers, & we could phone the organisers to let them know we were looking for it.

I called him out for the comment but turned around to see a picture of an orange armchair where she’d bitten a big chunk out of one side of the back, so it had one corner bitten right off with springs and stuffing sticking out, & I thought, “That guy’s got a point - she really is a “goer”!”  I went out to take a shower and came to a really tall sort of staircase or metal climbing frame and climbed to the top, where I could only get to the bathroom by climbing across a perilous gap & I realised that I was doing this in the wrong direction. Normally I’d be climbing across from the other direction and heading downwards, which would be much easier. I realised that at my current age & fitness level I couldn’t get across the gap from here & was scared to move. There was a mirror beside me and when I saw myself in it, the reflection was a quite good looking teenage male, about 17 or 18 years old, & I thought, “I’m not a bad looking young man, but I do need a shower.” B (husband) and I were having dinner with Cathy. She was looking very slim and well, dressed in a smart plaid shirt in shades of brown & orange that went well with her blonde hair. Although I didn’t actually like the shirt, I complimented her on how well it suited her. She served us a stew out of a big pot. It had lots of vegetables and good ingredients, but was a bit disgusting and slimy to eat, but B & I were polite and said nice things about it as we ate. Cathy said this was a dish she really liked to cook for guests, and I agreed that it’s really good to have a signature dish that’s tasty and easy to cook. Thinking about my own family favourite “Syrian Chicken”, which is tasty, but a lot of work, I wondered if this would be my version of Cathy’s “go-to” dish.",443,2,3,0,2,4,31-aug.-20,0,64,1,1,0,4,5,4,5,5,4,5,3,4,1,30,78,31,22,98,3.2,3.14,4,2,5.87,62.87,4.29,1.58,1.13,0.68,0.45,0.23,0,0,0.88,0.88,16.93,8.8,0.26,0.26,15.35,9.71,5.64,0.57,0.57,DD_Report_pruned,1,7.22,0.45,0,2.03,0,14.9,9.26,1.35,0.23

I had a special box with compartments in it, and there were several keys in the box, of two different shapes. It was hard to be sure which was the right key. They were copper-coloured, and one set had big round ends where you grip them, with transparent amber-coloured glass/plastic inserts. It was important to give right keys to someone in secret way. There was a man watching me, and I couldn’t be sure whether he was an enemy agent or someone I could trust, so I didn’t know how much I could safely reveal to him. There’s a lady offering tea, other foods. I accept, he doesn’t.  Olga is sick in Perth. Dad goes to WA see her. I’m amazed to realise that this is his first time ever in a plane, and wondering how the trip is going for him. What to wear? I put on a pale green top under long, patterned cardigan that I usually wear over a dress with a grey long-sleeved T-shirt underneath for warmth. I never normally wear this outfit with the green top but it looks good, and is warm enough if I wear grey cardigan on top. For some reason I need to dress nicely.

They’ve broken part of their back fence down. I’m standing in our back gate, looking across the lane and screaming, “Go broke! Please go broke!” as loud as I can. An older woman with bleached blonde hair – looking like an elderly Italian-Australian grandmother – hears me and asks why I’m shouting. I shout passionately, “Because I don’t want them to build those horrible, ugly units.” I believe at this stage that the woman is connected with the builders, and want to be as insulting as possible. She asks why they’re so bad. I go into detail: “They wanted to put 10 on the block – at least they’ve had to reduce that to 9, but it’s still too many, and some of them will be 3 storeys. Our next door neighbours will have no privacy at all in their back yard. And they’re really horribly ugly.” She asks what’s so ugly about them, and I say, “They’re really sterile flat roof, flat front, white boxes with nasty panels of grey cladding.”  I realise that the woman is actually a neighbour, standing on stairs at back of a house next door to that block, and she’s agreeing with every word. I’m walking downhill along a dirt driveway towards a road with my sister, stepping over an earth ditch or drain along the way, talking about wanting to be a grandparent, and how it’s really down to just 2 of our 4 sons, both of whom have female partners, but are not married and as far as I know have no family plans. I said to my sister maybe the son who told us he’s bisexual might adopt one day if he stays with his male partner, because he does seem to like kids – or maybe somewhere down the track he’ll find a female partner, but his brother who is gay definitely doesn’t want kids, so, I said to my sister it’s up to the other two boys!  I’m in a place where there’s a kitten or a young rabbit running around in a yard or a room. I lean over a wall or a fence and pick the kitten up and start explaining to our youngest son “The female has a very complex reproductive system because of the shape of its uterus/fallopian tubes” (seeing a mental image of the organ in question, which as far as I remember looked like a cat’s horned uterus), thinking that this would be of interest to him as a student of reproductive biology. I was serving bowls of ice cream topped with dollops of cream for me and B. We were about to drive somewhere to meet someone.  I started eating mine and said to B, “Why not enjoy the ice cream now because it will melt by the time we get there,” & give B his share. He sits in the car eating it.  We’re driving somewhere for a picnic following friends/family in another car. Car ahead of us pulls over into camping spaces beside the road and we pull over behind them. There are no tents pitched there, but there are things lying around in the camping spaces that suggest people might already have claimed them. We park there anyway, explaining that we’re not camping here, just parking for a little while. Other families in a row of tents behind these sites, a little farther off the road are having a picnic, sitting on tartan rugs. We walk past, saying hello. There’s a red, hammock-like synthetic fabric swing nearby, belonging to their kids. I swing on it, and realise as I swing, that I’ve peed right through it.

These bananas were hanging in bunches from vines really high up in the trees, and the men were skilfully scrambling up and down the vines like rope climbers, cutting down the bunches and bringing them back to me, where I was supposed to be helping out somehow, but all I could really do was tidy up the bunches by pulling off any dead bits & rubbish. I thought I’d get in trouble if I didn’t look busy, but they were all so high up in the trees that I didn’t have any bananas to work on, so I sat down on some concrete steps to watch them. It was very hot and sunny so I started applying sunscreen that was really white, thick, sticky and greasy, and I commented to someone who was with me what revolting stuff it was, but I had to smear it all over my neck, face and arms. I was wearing my dark purple top with the matching amethyst pendant, and was worried that the awful sunscreen might damage the pendant. I was no longer at the banana picking, the scene somehow having kind of transitioned into a garden party where I was being introduced to a sister of my real-life nephew’s wife, Catherine. This woman introduced herself and her husband, and I introduced myself to them, but I didn’t quite catch their names. I went with the woman to do something - either get some drinks, or get stuff from a cloakroom - and while we were waiting at the counter I quietly apologised to the woman, saying, “I’m sorry, but I’m really terrible with names and I need to practice so I get this right. Can you please tell me your name again.” She said her name was Katinka. “And what is your husband’s name?” I asked. He appeared beside me, saying in a very posh English voice, “My name is SIR Jeremy Throssington-Smythe. A lot of  people call me Thross.” Apparently just calling him Jeremy would not be acceptable and I was a bit put off by the SIR thing, but was embarrassed to call him Thross, and felt the whole name was a bit of a mouthful, so I said, “If you don’t mind, I think I might end up just calling you ‘Hey!’”   By this time we were back at the tables in the garden and I was explaining apologetically to  Katinka that I often feel socially awkward, and she pointed down at a book that was lying on the ground under the toe of her shoe, that was full of stories about how to cope in socially awkward situations. I thanked her and started looking through the book. Then I was back with my husband B, who remembers lots more people than I ever can, and told him about the encounter. When I mentioned Sir Jeremy etc etc, B said, “He’s the British foreign secretary!” I was a bit embarrassed that I hadn’t known that, and felt rather ignorant, but I really am very bad with names.",522,2,4,0,1,4,31-aug.-20,0,64,1,1,0,4,5,4,5,5,4,5,3,4,1,30,78,31,22,98,3.2,3.14,4,2,3.26,7.95,0.96,2.3,1.15,0,1.15,0.19,0,0,0.84,0.84,17.82,9.96,0.34,0.34,18.39,14.18,4.21,0.59,0.59,DD_Report_pruned,1,9,0.38,0.96,2.3,0.96,13.03,9.2,1.92,0.77

For some reason I thought it would be more environmentally sustainable to do it in a hole in the ground, which must have had a bucket in it, because then I was carrying the bucket and its contents into a toilet block in the hope of flushing the contents away and washing the bucket, but I had to wait behind a whole lot of people. At some other point I was on white/grey sand, possibly near a beach, and explaining to B [husband] that I could pee in the sand and leave it looking as if nothing had happened. I demonstrated, brushing dry sand over the wet patch so that it was soon hidden. Our friends “John & Jenny” had a fourth baby who was toddling round a room. I was watching her round face, blonde hair and stocky physique and commenting that she reminded me a lot of one of their 3 other now adult daughters. Someone was disagreeing and suggesting that she was more like another of the daughters.  I had met a woman I really liked and wanted to get to know her better. She was lonely because something had happened to her husband but she was wary of becoming too friendly with someone new. We enjoyed each other’s company for a while, but I could see that she was a bit suspicious of my motives so I decided to go for now, but wanted to swap phone numbers so we could get in touch later. I found an old scrap of paper that already had my name and address on it, tore off that part of the page for her, writing my phone number down the side. I asked for her number. She gave me the name of a website, saying, “You can find me here.” I said it was lucky she worked for a small business where I could find her on the website, because if I’d given her the Victorian Education Department website she wouldn’t have had a hope of finding my name there. After leaving it occurred to me that I hadn’t given a moment’s thought to my own partner. This partner was in jail for some reason, and I realised that I hadn’t seen him or even asked about him since his imprisonment. Whoever this partner was, I really disliked him and wanted to be rid of him, thinking the prison sentence might be grounds for a divorce. I was talking to someone about this and then realised angrily that no one in the Justice Department, no social workers or any support agency had reached out to me to guide me in how to behave under the circumstances. I was ranting angrily, “not a single word of guidance!!!”  and similar grievances - not that I really had any interest in that partner or his wellbeing, but it made me feel better about it having someone else to blame for my ignoring him.",496,3,4,0,1,4,31-aug.-20,0,64,1,1,0,4,5,4,5,5,4,5,3,4,1,30,78,31,22,98,3.2,3.14,4,2,5.04,17.87,2.42,2.62,2.02,1.01,1.01,0,0.4,0.2,0.95,0.95,18.55,8.87,0.42,0.42,20.16,13.31,6.85,0.69,0.69,DD_Report_pruned,1,7.46,0.6,0.2,4.44,0.2,14.31,11.29,0.6,0.81

Main character in the dream seemed healthy enough but there was some question about whether  she had signs of having had the poison in the past, or whether it was going to have delayed effects. I was talking to Gavin about his retirement plans. His wife and his cat were there, just like we see them on Zoom rehearsals.  I was with a friend listening to a recording of some man playing a piano piece famously badly, and I decided to play along, using some old sheet music I had, but taking so long to find the right page in the battered old music book, that the piece was pretty much over by the time I was ready to join in, but saying to whoever I was with that I’d have a go at playing it anyway.  I was walking in the country on a path along a ridge above a very green forest. A beautiful bright yellow cockatoo was on the ground. It was rather flat, sort of 2D & folded in half, but alive and healthy. I picked it up so that its wings opened out, and stroked its long beautiful feathers, and encouraged it to fly away, which it eventually did, but rather reluctantly.  I was trying to show people a quick route to a house where we were going to stay, but kept being prevented from getting there by no-entry & one way street signs.  I was in an old, derelict-looking building, maybe some kind of science lab or factory, with a chunky framework of hollow metal beams, painted red, with blue cladding filling the spaces between the framework  beams. The surface under the red paint was lumpy, as if the metal was rusting. I realised that those hollow beams in the walls were full of boiling water under high pressure, and I was rushing around warning people that the boiling water was about to come bursting through any weak spots in the rusty framework . We kept escaping corridors and rooms just in time through doors with really dodgy, rusty-looking locks that might not open. The rusty red framework had uprights either side of those doors, so as we struggled to open the doors I had my eyes on the door frames the whole time, expecting to be drenched in boiling water at any moment .",413,3,4,0,3,4,31-aug.-20,0,64,1,1,0,4,5,4,5,5,4,5,3,4,1,30,78,31,22,98,3.2,3.14,4,2,4.84,14.88,2.18,2.66,0.48,0,0.48,0,0,0,1,1,15.5,7.99,0.42,0.42,10.65,6.54,4.12,0.71,0.71,DD_Report_pruned,1,3.63,1.45,0,0.97,0.24,17.43,8.96,0,2.91

All I can find is some sort of toy - either an old BB gun type thing my Dad used to own when I was a kid, or some toy that fires clear plastic pellets. I fire it at the man, but it’s very weak and the pellets fall short. The man laughs at my attempt to attack him, but I keep firing, getting closer, but the pellets just bounce off him and he continues to laugh at my efforts. Then, unexpectedly one of the pellets hits his neck and draws blood. At first I think he’ll just shake it off, but then he falls to the ground in a pool of blood. Later on I’m in a train in a foreign country, maybe South Korea. I’m on my way to meet someone, probably my son R, & I think husband B might be with him. They’ve given me instructions on how to get there. I’m supposed to get off at stop 4 - or is it 5 or 6? There’s an electronic information display in the train, but everything is written in a foreign script except for a number at the end, and I’m confused about whether this is a stop number or a zone number, and before long I’m confused even about which number I’m looking for. The compartment I’m in is extremely private, clean and comfortable, with curved walls and seat all lined with a matt black fabric patterned with a large diamond-shaped grid of thin gold lines. I remember someone telling me that the Koreans take enormous pride in their trains, and am impressed by what I see. I sit in my compartment, watching the urban scenery flash by, and trying to make sense of the display on the sign as the numbers on the end go up 1, 2, 3, 4... Am I supposed to get off here or at the next stop? The PA announcements are no help to me as they’re all in Korean or something. Then I notice to my horror that the numbers on the sign are going back down again, so the train must have reached the end of the line and be on its way back. Soon I’ll be back where I started! If I ever get to where we’re meant to meet, I’ll be really late. And now I can’t remember at all which stop it was meant to be. I wish I’d written the instructions down on a bit of paper instead of trusting my memory! Can I just stay on the train and head back the other way again and get off at Number 4, whatever that means? Would my ticket still be valid or will an inspector notice that I’m travelling on an expired ticket? How do I even buy a new ticket? Can I use a card or does it have to be cash? All I have in my purse is some Australian money - about $35 in notes and a handful of coins which I’d have to exchange for local money. In the dream I remember a terrifying real-life experience 2 years ago with B and our youngest son, Al, on a bus in Poland where confusion over how to buy tickets led to a menacing ticket inspector threatening us with a huge fine for fare evasion, and although I eventually managed to tearfully plead our out of the fine, during the argument with the inspector, images flashed through my mind of ending up alone in a foreign prison. The situation felt frighteningly similar to the Polish real-life nightmare, and I was beginning to panic, again feeling the fear of being in trouble with foreign laws. I felt helpless and afraid.

She’s thankful for the help and I’m pleased to have been if assistance and sprites because I appears this is a specific math problem - not my area.  I’m then in the pub beside the outside area and am having a drink with her. She starts to become enamored with me which I’m not comfortable with. She is now male with a long blond mustache.  I go to another section of the pub across the road - again an old Victorian era space with vey sigh ceilings and lots of glass windows . I speak with someone I can’t now remember and soon leave going into the other space. The nan with blond mustache is there and us surprised to see me thinking I had left.

141,85,0,,,9/7/20 1:19,07.09.2020,745,"I’m on holiday with family in a small town, possibly in a skiing area, but it’s not ski season. It feels like New Zealand and Australia. The wether is overcast and may have jus stormed. It’s cold. The house is expensive but not that well furnished. There are mattresses but no beds. I think we are there with another family. It’s dark in the house and the rooms are in a strange configuration one leading onto the next in an usually lay out.   It makes me think of Tarkovsky’s Nostalgia, the witches house and the main house where the camera tracks through the space as if fl paying. There’s also the memory that there is something haunted or uncanny about the house. We try to subtly convince  either my son or someone else they shouldn’t sleep in a room but they don’t pay attention.   I try and lift them out of the room while they’re asleep picking up the whole mattress with them in it. It isn’t heavy but has a closet enveloping feeling.   I also find myself in a work environment in a two story building in a commercial street. It feels like a combination of two different jobs I have had - in Telemarketing and Education both to do with vocational training.  Things are going on but I’m not quite sure what and I feel somewhat disconnected from the others - this is not upsetting but more an observation.  I go walking because I need a good coffee. The street feels like a mixture of Wellington, NZ, Melbourne and Marrickville  Sydney. Again the weather is darker or twilight-ish I’m walking along the café strip looking for some where open but most of them are about close.  A woman counting up lets me into one cosy space and I have a coffee. The aroma and taste a rich and flavorsome - and dominate my senses and experience.  Back in the sky town. I’m leaving I think but am riding on a mountain bike and taking an unsayable route across country. This is an arid rocky place with sandy yellow/white coloured shale, rocks and hills.  I hear a signal ahead and bike harder trying to get i point  past the signal without stopping. As I come in line with signal I see an antique steam train, with out steam, heading towards me out of a tunnel. I bike out of its way but am amazed by the archaic style of the train - not yet a quintessential Victorian steam train but something with odd carriages and boilers perhaps even constructed together out of wood. It’s very dusty and feels like it is part of a western movie.   I ask a man if it us an antique and he says it is.  I keep biking and the dustiness soon gives way to amazing vistas ahead. Green forested fills to the left and sheer red rock cliffs and buttress-like  mountains to the right (like monument valley) but towering high like mountains. The sun is on the red rocks and the vista us very moving.  I find myself in another town by the mountains and bike past an area that seems like a record. It feels European like Chamonix  mont blanc. I ask a man possibly the same man from the train what the buildings are. They are a ski resort but the town is very quiet with current circumstances. I want to help out.",569,4,3,0,1,1,1-sep.-20,0,54,0,1,1,3,3,3,3,4,3,4,3,3,3,28,78,34,15,97,2.4,2.57,2,3,2.46,32.41,1.58,0.7,0.88,0.53,0.18,0,0,0.18,0.17,0.17,14.59,7.03,0.3,0.3,12.48,7.56,4.92,0.24,0.24,DD_Report_pruned,1,5.27,0.88,0,0.18,1.23,13.88,0.53,7.73,1.05

I’m fine with her doing thus but worried we don’t have any food, cheeses or olives.  The house we’re in transforms a little. It has an L shaped back wall with doors on both sides of the l junction to go out to the courtyard. I seem to remember blue new weather boards but the change makes it more palatial.  The doors outside are now long open walls with large round reddish beams holding up the roof above us. It’s airy. The floors inside are still the same a dark reddish stained new floor boards - very nice and clean.  I’m now returning with olives and for some reason encourage the cat to take olives from my mouth.   I then see my father in the yard eating olives and drinking. He then seems pleased with himself and shows us all how he can do what I just did, feeding the cat olives in the same way.  I’m annoyed and think he’s being competitive and dishonest. I’m also annoyed that the car that did thus with me is doing this with my father. I then find myself at a function at a big house with extensive courtyards. Im with a group of people and I remember being dresses in jive trousers and a white cotton shirt. The fabric is crisp and the shirt is airy.  The house is airy with extensive sliding doors that bring the outside in.  A friend comes over to me an architect I know from skateboarding. He’s angry at a mutual friend Angel. I ask why he thinks he the friend is duplicitous. He is adamant that nothing the friend says is true. That he is lying about thus that and the other, also about his family. I don’t think what he says adds up. I Enter somewhere airy in the same grounds where a lot of young women are arriving in ornate and structural architectural dresses. The young women enter a modern building and go up the stairs where the look at the dresses in a mirror excited to have got to wear these elaborate constructions.  I go from observing to being one of the dress wearers but I don’t see myself. I feel the fabric. Coming up around and out throw my waist to my shoulders - it’s warm but airy.  There’s also an inner part that comes up inside the cone that I feel against my chest - it’s silty but layered as if padded. One of young woman in particular stands out and is enamored with the dress she wears - in a sweet and endearing way. She’s pretty with long blond ringlet hair.  I mention how cumbersome theses architectural dresses are and she laughs in agreement. I used to like her a lot and I had a chance with her but turned it down as I was friends with her boyfriend. She turned up in the media latter married to two prominent sportsmen. I’m then at a suburban sports ground. A feeder team in the Canterbury Bankstown Bulldogs are upping the ante.   They want to keep the earnings from their games, as they are doing well unlike the top team in the main competition.   I’m not seeing this as a partisan but more as an outside observer.",575,4,3,0,1,1,1-sep.-20,0,54,0,1,1,3,3,3,3,4,3,4,3,3,3,28,78,34,15,97,2.4,2.57,2,3,2.96,43.56,2.26,0.7,1.39,0.7,0.7,0.17,0.52,0,0.23,0.23,17.74,9.22,0.45,0.45,14.43,11.13,3.3,0.34,0.34,DD_Report_pruned,1,6.09,1.04,0,3.48,0.52,15.83,1.91,9.22,0.87

I’ve had this dream before. I’m then with my old work boss. We’re all out for lunch.I have to change to change for an appointment. My suitcase is spilled open on the back of a flat deck truck. I change for meeting on the truck. Not sure about my selection of clothes or about getting changes in front of old boss. I put on a white shirt over a white t-shirt . Not me. I’m not embarrassed about changing in the open it just feels a bit off. I find myself in a building and some guy is setting up to pitch a script to some dim execs. It feels like Hollywood I think it’s a Robin Hood script and the writer has rolled it up tight and is trying to nail it to the wall - I assume to make it seem like an arrow that he will reveal to be the script at some point. I laughter at this because it us funny and misguided. I stop him and suggest I’ll help him. I’m then in a cinema complex with my partner and we are taken by our son in to see a movie but he’s a toddler - as he was when he was little. My partner is putting him in a line. We’re in a rush and are Late with getting him in. We have tickets, and some stranger recorded nexus formate of the film. I’m worried the ticket seller will think we’ve bought the film and not tickets to see it in the cinema so I rush us through. Again my partner has our son in the line. I go to join them but find the way I go up is separated from them by a large concrete walled corridor. I go back to find them but and as I turn into an intersecting corridor I walk in the way of two white American teenagers or early twenty somethings. The yell in fright when they see me walk out in front of them. I try to flippantly calm their fright by telling them not to worry, “I’m an Australian and we sometimes we done times walk at strange angles”. The nervously laugh at this explanation. I then find myself outside the line area in the complex wondering how I’ll pick up my sone at the end of the film when the film I’m going to see will run longer. The space I’m in is like a mezzanine level below where I was. Under the floor where I was is a wall of blue windows with glass framed by thick aluminum. I can tell if their us an aquarium behind it or a fun parlor. I then from bd my self I the pitch meeting building and a dark haired attractive woman is suggesting I pitch my script - possibly a fictional espionage conspiracy script. I’m not sure what happens but the woman who is possibly a manager or producer in the film business sits on my lap and puts her arms around me. This all feels a little weird even though i find her attractive but also familiar - a bit like someone I know but not her. The hair is more asymmetrically cut and black and she is more serious and focused than the person I know. While she’s talking me into pushing g my project she just starts kissing me. I like that she’s doing but also feel a bit controlled and nervous and that I’m going to be caught out by my partner. I also have the weird sensation of our tongues connecting in our mouths - the connection feel as if they are their own beings somehow disconnected and the mouth it’s own slippery universe or biological cave. I withdraw and stop our kissing. She looks at me seriously, apprising me. I’m then in a mother level of the building and the two American guys I walked in front are standing with rifles on another level of the pitch/cinema building. There is a glass wall and the room beyond seems to be at the bottom of a large flooded space or an internal building lake space. The Americans guys seem to be part of a militia or are conspiracy believers - though are dressed normally. Things start to get funny. There is a dead man/drowned in the deep watery space behind the glass. A script he was holding floats beside him. I laugh. The title, I can’t remember, suggests a conspiracy script and contains all the answers to unravel that conspiracy. It us of course fiction - the script I was going to pitch earlier- but I know the guys looking in think it’s real. I’m not sure how it got there but gave a memory of an amusing series of events. Any way the American guys decide they are going to shoot the glass out to get the script and what they think is proof. As the work out witch glass pane to shoot out I wonder what they will do when millions of meters if water rush out. I know find myself outside walking down a glass area with family friends. My son, still a toddler is walking along the opposite side of the grass lined street a bit behind us. The couple are seeing me off I think. As we walk and talk the wife, a tall woman, hugs me very close and cries that no one thinks she’s pretty. I say she is but thin she’s more attractive. I pull away and see here with deep etched in winkles and exaggerated features as if she is wearing stage makeup - similar to that in the Charlie Kaufman film final I just watched on Netflix. Her huge is also strange. In real life she is tall but her I had crouch down to be able to hug her.

In the one of buildings/cabins I remember a desk close to the door with a desk lamp lighting the documents, and books on it.  being out at sea on the boats - fishing boat or patrol boat size and possibly made from aluminum. The sea is high and tumultuous  as it was by the peers where the boat was moored, and black for a lack of stars or moon. It feels like there is a storm. But I don’t sense wins or rain.  I see two of these boats like I’m looking at them in a wide shot. There’s danger but I don’t seem affected by it.  When I’m at sea I feel like this on the Kapiti Coast in NZ our by the island but it also seems different- somewhere else.  I’m on the shore in the day, again on a Kapiti coast beach. The island is out there in the distance but it seems I can also walk there when the tide is out. I’m located in a building complex that feels like it could be a series of duplexes or an old hotel complex - like in the movie The Lobster. It us also a palace of some sort and I’m moving around the outside of the building - out the back and on the beach side. There’s an area with outside furniture. Wooden frame canvas couches.     In my mind I’m with some one but I’m not sure who. The notion that someone important has died is in my head - someone like the queen mother. I or we desire to move the furniture because it should or needs to be moved because of the death. I’m not sad it’s just something to be done.  We take the furniture out to a sand beach on the island and place it with  other furniture in a bid sandy area in the lea of a hill/sand dune and arrange it in an appropriate way.  The the space seems changed sand drifts cover i arts of the furniture and low wooden fences and the area seems list for jack on maintenance or time.  Next I’m in a car driving from town to town, possibly going home. My father is driving. I’m in the back seat and there are two other people. The area is like the Kapiti hinterland but there are also high volcanic outcrops like in Queensland.  Dad stops in a town and wonders why the keys are sitting in a prominent position on the dash.

141,86,0,,,9/14/20 1:28,14.09.2020,715,"I’m riding around an urban space on a mountain bike and find my way into a school area. I thinks it’s a primary school and the buildings are modern and single story. I bike around one building and find groups of people siting on the ground in the shadows. They are maybe homeless but I’m not sure. This is not where they should be.   I bike up past them and the find myself  at a modern glass café that feels like it is part of a university. I think it might be raining. I go in for a coffee and I’m waiting in line with some other people. There is a woman with a few other people waiting. She has a sandy blond bob - a bit of gray showing through and feels older than I am, even though we are a similar age. I get my coffee and food. She isn’t impressed and will go elsewhere. I tell her that I’m here at the university and that it’s convenient.  After she’s gone I’m talking with the woman who runs the café - I think she’s one of the woman from Ralph’s café at Sydney uni in real life. I now gave more things and ask if I can pick up my trestle table tomorrow morning. There is a lot of wind and I don’t want to carry it while holding the other items I have and looking for the car.  The trestle is a white gray plastic tucked in behind some tables.  While one of the staff is confused by this the manager/owner seems to understand.   I head off and have to remember where the car is. I have a good idea but am a little unsure. The streets feel like Melbourne but are hillier like Wellington or the Easter suburbs of Sydney.   I must find the car despite my confusion and find myself at a development sight/junkyard. A large scale project us about to begin soon and my father, whose name is actually Ralph,  is in charge of the project. I’m looking at the scene unfolding from on top of a high stack of scaffolding steel that has not been assembled maybe 2 meters above the dark brown  muddy ground where a large group of people wearing white hard hats and lab coasts are being spoken to.  I’m more worried about the cats. One of them our Burmese Coco is below the scaffolding and is annoyed, biting and scratching me for some reason.   I picked her up, cautiously because of her mood and go back to the house - a house where we gave been staying temporarily. There’s dark brown set soul around the house too. I go inside and find the cat. There are now two of them. One annoyed and the other compliant. We leave the house and a black Staffordshire Bull Terrier starts parking at the placid cat, now on the ground beside it. I rush in and tell the dog off and get the cat. The dogs is just surprised by the cat who says sorry for causing the dog a fright. I note that it’s interesting the placid cat can speak English.   I’m now drinking around Melbourne possibly to find the car and my life partner gives me some directional instructions. I start driving off and she thinks I’m heading in the wrong direction. I assure her I know what direction I’m heading in and point out the window towards the city. We are on the East side of the river and can see the city. It’s nit actual Melbourne but a constructed version of the city that often appears in my dreams. It’s built up and denser than the real city.  I’m now in bed waking up but wanting more sleep. I can feel the cat moving in the bed and I’m a little annoyed.   When I open my eyes I see it isn’t the cat but our son but as a seemingly fetus like baby in a crawling position. I realise from his eyes that he’s still asleep so I settle him down and cover him up.  I can get more sleep",690,3,2,0,2,1,1-sep.-20,0,54,0,1,1,3,3,3,3,4,3,4,3,3,3,28,78,34,15,97,2.4,2.57,2,3,1.88,12.62,0.43,1.16,1.45,0.14,1.01,0.29,0.43,0,0.21,0.21,18.26,9.28,0.32,0.32,14.78,11.74,3.04,0.26,0.27,DD_Report_pruned,1,7.68,1.01,0,1.88,0.72,13.48,1.16,9.86,1.45

There is the sense if there being a shark in the water. It’s big and may have already tried to come at us. I have impressions from under the water of the sharks body. It’s close and rubs past me with it’s side, white and large in the murky water. Strangely I’m not nervous. I gave an aluminum poll. I thinks it’s an extendible painting roller handle to reach high walls that I’m using to ward the shark off - but it doesn’t seem to come back or if it does it’s staying away.   Then I’m meant to be going out with a friends friend who has just had a break up in a relationship. I’m not sure if I want to be there or not. She is attractive but in a handsome and character filled way. She has black shoulder length hair and is wearing a rusty red silk shirt and a three quarter length fitting skirt white/off-white. We have a coffee in a café, with red brick floors and walls and wooden tables. I think our Maltese Australia friend is monetarily there. The woman as I said is quite striking, possibly Maltese as well, or perhaps of Spanish or even Indian origins.   We walk through a plaza  in a cross between a Sydney space and another European space, again made from dark red bricks.  I want to ask her about her break up but don’t, not finding the right time. I wonder when we are going to the films and what she wants to see. She suggests we watch two films but I’m worried that will take too long and I have to get back to my own partner who is waiting for me at a wedding.   I walk some more with her along a road and railway line. A child , male and 10ish, has a skateboard and is ushered off. I wonder if there is a Skateboard park somewhere near by and think about going for a skate myself.  We then find ourselves at the house where the wedding is taking place . A large group of people head out into the garden where I find my partner. Again as with the entire dream the weather is cloudy and overcast. We are all waiting for something to happen but before it does the crowds are gone and myself and my partner look around the house which it seems we gave moved into. It is an older weatherboard house, 1940’s or 50’S-ish and needs a bit of upkeep. It also has several buildings, a studio, with pallets of produce laid out by its front veranda attracting a gust of beetle-like insects. Apparently the previous owners grew the produce and have to pick them up. I think the insects will make that a futile task though I’m not overly concerned.  My partner and I are out and about in a an inner city Wellington NZ suburb like Berhampor. I think we get a call that their is trouble at our house. Our son’s party seems to have got out of hand with a mass of gatecrashers. We go hone and go into the garage, which has no roof and big glass doors onto the toad and a bunch of twentyish young men come in. My sons friends who have seemingly resolved the situation and removed the troublemakers. The police will not be needed to  be called.  Again my partner and I are elsewhere in a small shopping area line Erskineville in Sydney but again either buildings in dark red bricks. We walk into a shop on our way home, to take a short cut and find we are slowed down because of Covid restrictions.  Not sure what the restrictions are because we are still allowed to moved Fi ward through the long skinny space with its cream plaster walls with the a warm painted concrete floor that may gave some straw laid on it in places.  The restrictions it seems involve walking single gone through the people in the café until the tables a bustle give way to a shop area with lots of good strewn on the floor. Thus makes our progress difficult as we have to pick past very delicate objects on the floor and the display cases.  At ones stage I reach into my pockets and find a handful of clear rounded crystals which I drop one of when I bring them out and hear a glass like crash when it falls on what appears to be a beautifully colored stone filled with green, blue, purple crystals (Paula shell colors). Broken crystals are everywhere.  I brush them under the draws and display units not wanting to be discovered but they’re everywhere and crunch u Der foot. The shop owner Gomes over but doesn’t seem to VFX see the breakage or be concerned. I however feel guilty but continue on.

My son and I were looking at a book together and discussing it. I’m not sure what it was about but it was a discolored paperback and may have been academic. My son sat on the edge of a seventies style couch while I sat on the floor leaning against it. For some reason it seemed to be of danish design but was upholstered with an unstylish and drab speckled brown fabric. The kind of furniture that might sit in an old family beach house.   Any way my sister walked past us out of the room and seemed happy. I then noticed that my oldest friend was having sex in the same space on the floor. I couldn’t see who he was with clearly because of the furniture between us. An older armchair, not danish, covered in the same fabric as the couch, a big chunky wooden coffee table, 1970’s or 80’s and a green lush plant in a bronze shining pot.   Any way I could see my friend having sex moving backwards and forwards like a jack rabbit. He was wearing a faded button shirt sleeved shirt I remembered him wearing before and a set of white brief shorts.   My reaction was one of annoyance and embarrassment at the fact he had chosen to have sex while we were in the room. I tried to ignore him but found his physical actions too distracting/irritating to do so.   The annoyance was then amplified when I thought... “ he’s not having sex with my sister is he?”. He then stopped and his partner got up off the floor which seemed strange as she had been in New Zealand, where they live, not Australia, and I wondered how she had appeared here.

Some thing I was doing would be problematic  because the students/ those involved be confused about what I was asking of them.

I was speaking to an Asian man and he said he couldn't do the bulk printing I needed as his English wasn't great and my stuff needed attention to detail. I called over to mum and Kat who were sitting next to each other half way down the long table. I was asking what we actually needed to get printed/if we really needed to get things printed. Kat rolled her eyes and had a bit of a go at me saying ""of course you don't need printing, and table decorations ""  as if I was putting down her choices. I knew that I already had candles maybe as the place name holders and didn't think we needed a ceremony printout. I knew it was a religious ceremony as the printout was going to have the prayers of the faithful in there.

There were tons of old school sports tube socks. The staff had to secure black plastic that was flapping in the wind. The rain started which I could see running down the large window behind our table.   it was more senses than visual. It was the same space, but I think we were all laying on the floor with doonas and sleeping bags etc. Felt like a party in your late teens/early twenties where you all crash at someones house. I remember having sex with someone, but only the feeling. It was spooning, and he was behind me. I have the feeling of him pushing inside me and then the angle changed and he couldn't get back inside me.

I was sitting on one side, a person to my left, and then the person sitting to her left was dark purple and black. On the opposite bank was mostly older people in their 60's and 70's. One of those ladies was trying to figure out if purple person was a guy or a girl. We could see her trying to be subtle and pointing in our direction to her neighbour. They were gossiping.

The subject of the photo started moving, like those Harry Potter paintings and I knew instantly that she was the right one for my (it felt like I was making a movie or needed her for something). Someone removed her overdress and was going to change her outfit and I insisted that the she stay the same. My friends Alanna and John from Queensland turned up and we were going to drive somewhere. John in a separate car to Alanna and I. I told them about the photo and the child and I think we were going to collect her?",180,2,1,0,2,1,1-sep.-20,0,58,1,1,1,1,1,1,3,4,1,4,2,3,1,18,69,21,23,89,2,2.43,6,1,0,20.23,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,18.33,7.78,0.5,0.5,16.67,11.11,5.56,0.75,0.75,DD_Report_pruned,1,5.56,1.11,0,3.89,0.56,13.33,10,0,3.89

I was wandering around with my friend - don’t know who it was but I think it was a girlfriend. A guy approached me to ask directions. He had a bag slung over his shoulder and he was his mobile phone. He ask about number 101 and where it was. I looked up and down the street and then asked what was he looking for and he said it was an insurance office. I suggested we look at the map on the his phone but I needed some reading glasses to see it clearly. He dug around in his bag and pulled out a large plastic syringe - it was filled with black solution. I recognised it as a drug and said to my friend and kind of to him too, “its bong water and really dark “ with the inference that it was good quality. Apparently the reading glasses were somehow in or attached to this? And he had to empty the contents to get at them...He went into the road house. Next we were inside a room together in a separate area - not the road house. It was an office space with carpeted floors and and tables and chairs. The were a bank of windows covered in white sheer curtaining/blinds that slid sideways. The sun was glaring and coming through. The guy was sliding the blinds to try and block our the glare. I looked up at his face and it was tanned and rugged but not handsome, I didn’t know him. One of the windows was slightly ajar and was letting in a cool breeze. I said it was lovely and fresh but my friend was cold and shifted herself away from the gap and turned her back. There were stacks of files and paperwork all over the table and we were there to help him find something in them. My friend who had her back us was attaching tubes  to her nipples and the when the guy walked in he kind of acknowledged this but ignored her and walked behind. We were back in front of the stalls and and woman was at the counter. She was tall and masculine and wearing bikers boots and had a jacket over her arm. I said to the guy that I recognised here and he confirmed he did too and that she was the chef/bar attendant from the bowling club but it was now permanently closed and she was unemployed.",443,1,1,0,2,1,1-sep.-20,0,58,1,1,1,1,1,1,3,4,1,4,2,3,1,18,69,21,23,89,2,2.43,6,1,1.58,36.33,1.35,0.23,0.23,0.23,0,0,0,0,0.97,0.97,18.06,9.03,0.67,0.67,17.61,12.87,4.74,0.82,0.82,DD_Report_pruned,1,4.06,1.58,0,6.32,0.45,13.09,12.87,0.45,0

The second door opened onto a large open room with high ceilings. It was a waiting room for a doctors surgery.The were some chairs and people sitting and standing. On top top of a small podium there was a sign in book and a lady was standing next to it. She seem to be over seeing the signing in process. She had next to the book a pile of undies. Small bikini bottoms with coloured graphics printed on them. Along the top edge, across the back of each pair, there was some kind of slogan. Mostly to do with porn. I picked them up to look. I moved over to the main desk which was shoulder high. There was another lady there with another sign in book. There was someone in front of me. I looked at the counter and to the left there was a medallion of meat. It was pale and surrounded by a ring of thin fat. I said it looked like a lean piece of pork.

148,130,0,,,9/3/20 1:02,03.09.2020,700,Starting outside at some event. It was evening and we were all getting ready to go back to a house. There was a Dutch? couple with a little child. A young man in his 20s and a younger boy. They were not related.There was food and I was with the young man watching him eat. He seemed a little drunk like we we had been at a party or something. He was sitting on some kind seat that had a round white table attached. He was naked and the table top was hiding his lower half but it had tilted up and bottom half was exposed. When I looked down at him his genitals were blurred out. He wasn’t concerned and we talked about where he would stay at the house. We all ended up at this big many roomed house that appeared to be a permanent residence I was familiar with. The asked the boy to change his sheets on his bed so the young guy could sleep there. It was really messy. The couple with the child appeared and I asked the little girl would she like to draw. I took her by the hand and we went in search of a jar of textas and pens and pencils I knew I had. But when I got there they were missing and I yelled out to someone to ask where they were and he said he’d lent them. I was annoyed. I was then in the bottom of an empty swimming pool with a sloping side. I was trying to lift the little girl who was now naked up to her parents but as much as I tried I couldn’t get her past the edge and they couldn’t reach her. No one was concerned.  I remember being inside a room looking out at a deck and some trees. There were two pigeon/dove type birds as large as chickens moving about in the branches. They were extremely bright and colourful lots of rainbow colours. One bird had its tail feathers all fanned out and it was beautiful. It seemed to be trying to attract the other bird. They came down on to the deck and one came through to the door into the house. I called for my partner to come and look at how beautiful they were but the birds wouldn’t put on the display. I thought if a scratched in on the back near its tail it may spread its feathers. I was rubbing and scratching its tail but the bird had turned into a naked woman on all fours and I was rubbing her tail bone.,442,1,2,0,2,1,1-sep.-20,0,58,1,1,1,1,1,1,3,4,1,4,2,3,1,18,69,21,23,89,2,2.43,6,1,2.04,23.08,0.9,0.68,0.68,0,0.23,0,0.23,0,0.97,0.97,19.46,10.18,0.63,0.63,16.06,12.44,3.62,0.8,0.8,DD_Report_pruned,1,4.52,1.36,0,4.52,1.81,14.93,12.67,0.45,0.68

Don’t know who he was but I think that he was extremely drunk and I worked out that he actually drove himself home. I saw another friend there and went over to say hi. It was a lovely warm encounter. Ben hugged me and we left the pub in a warm, friendly arm in arm embrace. Nothing romantic. Just friends. Laughing and chatting about having something sweet to eat and cup of tea at his place. Our houses were close to the pub, as was the other guys house who left early. We walked by there to check if he got home and that’s when we saw his car. He’d been putting together /building a coffee table of sorts for his wife and we were looking at outside the house.It was pretty shonky and looked like one those slot together pre cut things. We went inside. Next thing I was in bed and next to me was another old friend, Robert. He was groggy and half asleep. But got out of bed and was naked. He pulled on a pair of black socks before heading to the bathroom... I then was in my mum’s house in the middle room. I was trying to sleep on a makeshift bed on the floor. There was someone else with me and I knew that there were many other people asleep in the rumpus room a couple of rooms away. I knew that my mum was out there too. I hear a car pull up in the driveway and said to my friend that it was my cousins with all the children. They were noisy. I looked at the time and it was midnight.

148,131,0,,,9/4/20 1:28,04.09.2020,715,"I found a baby seal. Not too sure about if it was a seal though. It was small. Arms cradling size. Grey and brown smooth and silky skin/fur. It could move around easily but seem to have no legs.It had no teeth. I know because I put my finger in its mouth and it sucked on it. All pink and gummy. There were other people in a the house were I was living but I even though I had a relationship to them, I don’t know who they were. The home was a facsimile of my family home. The little seal needed to be wet occasionally but I knew it wasn’t crucial. He got into the bathtub. I had to go away and needed someone to care for him for a few days. I knew that my neighbours would probably do it but had to go and see them. I left the seal in the house and went next door. My neighbours were my actual old neighbours from 20 years ago. Phil and Sue. Their daughter Megan was there too she was the age she would have been 20years ago. They were busily doing jobs and huffing and puffing at each in frustration and not really speaking. It was a bit awkward to ask. But I sat and talked to them for a bit. Then the seal was there and Sue said that Phil didn’t like them. Especially their mouths? There was a big kitchen island bench with shelves below and the was a plate with cat biscuits spilling over. The seal started trying to eat them and I got down on my hands and knees and  tried to clean them and stop him from eating them. I then found myself in front of a closed door that was supposed to be a pub or some kind of venue. I had a brown paper ticket in my hand that was printed with some offer and I was going to redeem it at the pub. There were three men standing outside, waiting too. We all though the place was closed but I opened the door and the pushed another door with my knee to swing it open (conscious that I didn’t want to touch the door with my hand). Inside were hundreds of people sitting at long wooden tables. It was kind of like a theatre restaurant and they were all brandishing large shiny knives. They were all wearing black face masks. These  people were on the left side of the room and on the right were large chunky wooden tables that were empty and had nothing on them. I ran and jumped on top and tried to slide on my butt towards the bar. The table wasn’t slippery enough and I got stuck just before the end. A bar maid came to me and said to get off that I wasn’t allowed to do that. She kind of half smiled at my antics. I gave her the ticket in my hand and she read it and laughed and showed the other barmaids. It apparently was an offer that didn’t start for another year. She threw it away. There was a master of ceremonies who was yelling instructions and everyone stood up with their big knives and swung them at the same time to cut something on their plates. I then remembered I didn’t have a face mask. There were other people walking around and I noticed a lady pushing a pram. She had a nurse’s outfit and there was a mask hanging from badge/pin/watch on the front of here clothes. I looked towards the door and now it was glass. There were many people trying to get in and there was a man giving out black face masks. There was one policeman who pushed past him, intent on getting inside. I knew he would fine me for not having a mask. So I found the nurse and lent over and hooked the mask from her chest. I put it on in such a hurry that it twisted-upside down and inside out. I turned around to face the policeman and mumbled  and kind of laughed my clumsiness. He looked at me and with a sad smile and said his name. He said “it’s me ??” And I knew him. He held me and kissed me very gently but firmly on the lips. I could feel his face and skin that was bristly. My left nipple went stiff and he brushed it. He said something about the seal being missing and I got very upset and started crying. My head pushed into his shoulder and left ear. I said I love him so much.

It was some kind of celebration, like a community picnic.We were part of this group and there were other groups set up beside the lake.The terrain was typical grazing land and there were some fences and the ground was uneven - no flat areas. Next thing Alanna and I were back at a hotel where we were staying the night - it was a two day event. We were going to go out but we were both tired. I fell asleep on the end of one of the beds with pillows stacked around me. I awoke  and looked out the window to see a biplane flying low and dragging behind a banner. There were other aircraft doing similar things. Even a helicopter towing something too. It was really early but we decided to walk back to  picnic ground. I was wearing cut off denim shorts and an old blue  t-shirt with no bra. I had strappy flat sandals on my feet. I remember it being really hot as we walked along the street and into the paddock. I kept adjusting my shorts and pulling at the legs to pull them down as they were a bit tight. We passed other groups all set up for the day’s activities. It had the feeling of a competition or event. I was concerned about not wearing a bra but I kept skipping and hopping through the rough paddock grass.I seemed to be a lot younger. Alanna said something about me being capable of playing basketball even though I wasn’t tall enough. We arrived at ‘our’ patch and there was no one there. It was too early for them. Then Robert arrived and other people slowly started to turn up. I really wanted to get changed and have a shower so Robert decided to walk back with and Alanna stayed.

We walked up a rise to a track and followed the dirt trail.To our left and up on a little rise there were some boys  on a flat trolley/barge  that was laden with boxes and supplies. One boy was rowing the thing to propel it along the ridge but there was a drop off coming up and he didn’t slow down even though I shouted to stop.

I could hear a small scuffling and fluttering sound coming from another room and went to investigate. There were two peewee pecking and attacking something. When I bent down they flew away and there was a small blue and green budgie. It crouched down and allowed me to pick it up. It was very scared but seemed to be uninjured. I shouted to someone to get the old cage from outside. They appeared with a bird cage that used to be pale blue, but the paint was mostly gone and the rust was taking over. I opened the lift up door at the front and put the budgie through the opening. It immediately hopped up on the rusty swing that was in the centre of the cage. I found two of the food and water dishes that hook over the bars of the cage. They were filthy and full of old food. I started to clean and wash them, but they morphed into large stainless steel dog bowls that were covered in bird poo.

I had to log into a security system and enter codes to the coin store remotely. I got some coins out for the presentation, and then recorded something - but watching it back I could see how it could be improved, parts to rephrase or leave out etc to make it better (e.g. I'd used some footage from a colleague from a previous workplace, using a big chunky mechanical stitching foot to sew baskets onto their display supports - the stitching foot squashed the top of the basket briefly as it pressed down so it wasn't really a great method and shouldn't be promoted). Plus I thought I hadn't expressed the benefits vs risks of displaying objects well enough, so that people watching would be able to make an informed decision. But then a textiles conservator showed up (two, actually - one a current colleague and one I'm not sure about) and said they would record the presentation instead. Also they had a kit of storage and display props that showed mounting methods for textiles really well - much better than what I'd used. So that was very good, button I was wondering about what to do about the coins, which shouldn't be left with 'unauthorised' staff. The coin store was also still open so the coins could be put away after filming. I wondered if I should close the store and leave the coins with the two conservators, but decided I needed to stay for the filming and lock the coins away properly afterwards. Then a security guard used the same remote security log in system to open the coin store remotely, knowing he'd be onsite later while a big stadium rock concert was on. So while he was on site the guard snuck up to the store, which was now unlocked, and stole things - though it seemed more like software and not coins after all. Also the software was on old three and a half inch floppy disks. The guard slipped out with the crow as they left the gig. The gig-goers also took software as they left, from an unattended table that seemed to be full of free merchandise. There were also free straw hats on the table. Then I was back in the collection store, eating pad thai. Food isn't allowed in collection stores normally but this didn't seem to worry me.

I liked the person I'd interviewed and was going to give him the keys but then thought oops I should let my friend meet him first.  Then there was an announcement on the radio that an earthquake was 20 minutes away so we all went out to sit on the grass in the backyard. There were four of us - me, the new flatmate and two of his friends, a woman and a teenager. Someone brought a mosquito net with us.  The garden was looking both chaotic and lush - lots of vegetables growing. Bindies and prickles were growing in the lawn - some of them in narrow rows, a bit like they'd been sowed properly but I had an idea the rows were made by something scratching or dragging across the dirt and they'd just settled in the furrows. The old lemon tree was still big and gnarled. The new flatmate was involved in music biz and had light brown skin. The three of them were talking about a song. The teenager started to tell me something about it quite earnestly, implying I would know this thing 'if I was older than 18', which I assured him I was, and we all laughed a bit because I am obviously older than 18 but he'd seemed not to notice. The thing I should know at my age was that if I worked in a museum I should have to sing his song in front of a mammoth specimen - I said I already did work at a museum and I hadn't thought to do this. The woman still wouldn't tell me why we needed the netting. Then the Manager of the Museum called me from work and said things were pretty rough and could I come in to either work in Dispatch or stand guard in front of the 'Wiggles poster'. I asked what was involved and he got all annoyed and said he had no time to explain and reiterated help was needed. I said sure, I'll come and help at Dispatch and hung up on him before he'd finished speaking. As I was getting ready I realised I hadn't asked if this would be paid overtime.

I remember thinking that there was a decent chance that the most previously unlikely of things could happen - I could win an Olympic running race I was singing something at the same time (quite well, I was very pleased with my pitch and tone) - and as I walked the 'course' I glanced briefly into an unfamiliar room I didn't remember, off the hall with the bedrooms and study - there were two strange men wearing coveralls sitting in there - I wasn't alarmed by this, I knew they were meant to be here and they didn't seem hostile - but I was briefly self-conscious that they'd heard me singing. Then I was trying to manoeuvre a tall, triangular-shaped box through the crowded aisles of an Asian grocery - I kept stopping to let people pass, or wait for them to move etc - but eventually I just kind of pushed my way through, around the end of one aisle and into the next, and people had to stop for me because the box I had was so big. I laid it down on its side under the glass doors of the frozen or cold storage area - it's highest point fitted 'just so' under the door so it didn't prevent them from opening and explained this to a few people as I opened it up briefly to show it held many partially eaten containers of ice-cream flavours. Then I left quickly before anyone could protest. I noticed my hair was getting very long but I thought it looked quite good, from what I could see of myself in Zoom calls - it was curling under at the ends instead of sticking out. Then I was back at an old workplace and one of my old colleagues who's usually quite lovely was being very snarky comments about my old boss and where she'd put a couple of trollies. I was a bit worried she was losing her marbles. Tidying up in the labs, someone else opened a cupboard and saw an old jar of yellowed resin and just tossed it straight in the bin - I was slightly in awe because I'd been dithering about whether I should throw it out and the proper way to dispose of it and she just DID it. I was kind of relieved, and vaguely surprised she could act so decisively. Then I was looking through some old notes of mine one of them had found - possibly old plans or notes for a talk, and some colour photocopies of pictures of family members that looked as if I'd laid them out so I could draw around them to make a calendar for my grandmother. I threw them out and wondered why they'd saved them for so long instead of just throwing them out themselves. Someone saw me looking through the old photos and came over to look at them over my shoulder, which I thought was very nosy and I wished the wouldn't, also they weren't very good photos. I didn't say that though.

It landed on top of a tall building in the middle of a city and blew up. But then we saw scenes from a different angle, before the impact, where he had put his hand through the driver's seat window to activate the airbags. At first it looked like it was just the fact of having an airbag underneath him (but with the car's roof in between) that saved him during impact, which I thought was pretty lame and unlikely, so then it altered again to show that he'd somehow managed to pull the air bag out and use it as a parachute to steer himself away from the car as it fell and to land safely on top of another building. The car might have been a helicopter now? Anyway it still crashed.  Then my friend Kate, one of my aunts (Sue) and my Mum were appointed temporary 'royalty' at an event with lots of people. Two bakers wheeled in two cakes and asked which one they'd like to try first - the plum cake or the pumpkin pie cake.

The hunt started with a zine that was pinned to a post in a grassy strip of land between two sides of a residential street. If you read the zine there were instructions to find the next clue. I think there were four clues all up and I was trying to figure out the last one - deciding perhaps I'd post something to be waiting at his own house. The penultimate clue led to a place that was quite remote though - down a dirt road out of town - I'd been there already and also left a litre for milk there for some reason - and I need to get back to place the written clue to the final destination.

Then he connected it to another query he'd had from someone who lived in a street in Werribee where I used to live as a child - and I exclaimed 'oh I used to live there!'. This query related to a subscription service that was offered for kitten and cat owners, I think where you were sent monthly supplies (food etc) and included benefits like checkups etc. I confessed to him I WAS interested in the deal - I thought it was good value - but I didn't sign up for it at the time because I was feeling cheap. Then I was looking at a dance routine I'd recorded of myself, and thinking I should save it to my phone (maybe for TikTok?). I was imitating a 'known' routine.

This was annoying the people I was working with. Some Soviets came by and objected to a cap one of us was wearing - one of our party knew this was because the cap 'presented' as Polish but was made from a Soviet cap that they'd put a bit of plastic decoration on (the use of plastic was very insulting to the Soviets, so the Polish made all their caps this way). It seemed to have a pull string fitted - when you pulled it a recorded voice said something.  Then I was in a house, I think my sister's, which was linked to the house of a couple who she doesn't like (and who aren't very nice). We walked through their house to get to one of the living areas, which was a big room set up for building with LEGO. We might have been looking for someone there? Next, a professional of some kind was proposing to treat someone's ear condition by using a Stanley knife (but cutting something in their ear canal). I was horrified and offered them one of my scalpels, which they accepted - but then I had to go into a filthy, cluttered garage to fetch out by toolkit. The garage was full of old crap - a car, a grotty mattress etc. Somehow a quote I'd prepared at a previous workplace came back to me in my current job at the Museum. The client wanted me to write them a Conservation Management Plan for a small museum, and my quote had been based on not being able to visit the museum in question - I'd have to base my recommendation on their notes and pictures. I originally thought they'd only sent me a couple of pages which wasn't going to be nearly enough, but I flipped through the notebook they'd sent again and it was full of observations, details and pictures. I was pleased because it would be a really straightforward job and I'd be able earn $2000 for my museum. Then I was leaving somewhere and went to the toilet - another person came into the toilet with me to talk on their phone and the cubicles weren't really separated from each other properly - no doors. So she could hear me going to the toilet - but she flushed hers to make some disguising noise, which was thoughtful of her. My toilet had no seat and the toilet roll holder was in the way of where you sat, plus the whole back window was made of regular window glass so there was nothing to stop anyone from looking in PLUS I totally undressed before I sat down.

Someone was reading from a 'scenario' sheet, and then a group of dancers started performing and moved up very close to the group - they were looking at us as they danced and making faces, and we were smiling and laughing.  Two senior staff from the museum and a more junior staff member appeared to address us - they were all wearing green and purple crocheted cardigans. The junior staff member was a ring in for their boss and made a joke about having checked the dress code first.  Then the museum morphed into a space that contained a kind of 'alt-world' or space, that you could only reach by passing through a number of special, significant trees (different varieties of large gum tree). There were proper ways through - when you had permission - but some people were finding their own ways in. One couple used a chainsaw to open up the trunk of one tree and pass through (the tree sealed up again).  Another couple found a way to open up a tree and went through, but it sealed up again before they'd completely emerged to the other side. They'd had their arms around each other in an embrace as they passed through the tree, and now they were mostly in the alt-space but one arm each was caught in the trunk, with a hand out in normal space. This was a known danger of passing through the trees, and could send people mad. One of the couple did panic and went momentarily mad, her head changed into the head of monster with lots of sharp pointy teeth and she bit off her lover's head. (It wasn't bloody, it just sort of disappeared in a puff.  She almost immediately returned to normal and realised what she'd done, and cried and despaired. Her lover's spirit was still present though - and in fact she herself seemed to be able to slip in and out of her physical body into a spiritual one - these looked like little peg dolls with faces made of felted wool or cotton. The surviving woman could look down and see her spiritual form sitting on her shoulder.  The junior staff member from before approached from the other side of the tree and 're-set' it - this involved zapping some little electrical points) - which healed the tree gateway. I think the body disappeared and the survivor was no longer trapped; she tried to call out to the archivist as she returned the way she had come (visible from inside the alt-space, and up some stairs) but the archivist couldn't hear her.  Then there was another part in a large rectangular or square building, with many many identical wood panels off the internal corridor, which lead into rooms around the edge of the building. We watched a sequence of short stories, gradually learning who was in each room and how they had got there - many had been lead into their rooms under false pretences. As we watched, we realised we were seeing different sides of things that were happening at the same time, or stories repeating themselves to accomodate actions others had taken (which then changed the outcome of the second story). There was a young man in one room who seemed separate to everything going on, and told other people what to do to affect the outcome of the stories. One man always became obsessed with a small figure on a shelf behind him, whenever a story had cause to bring him into this room. Another woman was instructed to put on a red dress and push-up bra. Another woman (who we hadn't really learned about yet) was wearing a fabulous sculpture dress and somehow had been drenched by the sea. She was shut into another room but we didn't learn her story.",711,2,2,0,2,2,1-sep.-20,0,46,1,1,0,2,3,3,4,5,3,4,2,3,1,25,52,27,21,92,2.4,2.57,4,1,2.53,20.23,1.27,1.27,1.27,0.42,0.84,0.28,0.28,0.28,0.99,0.99,15.47,6.89,0.92,0.92,10.83,7.17,3.66,0.95,0.96,DD_Report_pruned,1,0.56,1.27,0.42,2.67,1.83,16.88,10.41,0.14,0.14
150,155,0,,,9/16/20 16:19,15.09.2020,750,"I was somewhere remote - I'd travelled over water to get there - someone had all the power and I think me and a younger girl were working to free us from the person in charge.  I passed some test somehow which meant I could put her on a train out of there - it was designed just for her. Somehow the train engine turned into a horse who had to pass over a terrifyingly wide and powerful river by crossing a narrow log.  The horse couldn't fail though - it was programmed to travel across the log - bu the entity had tricked us, and the log was too short - it stopped short of the other bank. We could even SEE the other side. The girl realised there was no way out - the train-horse couldn't return, and she knew eventually the log would fall into the river, which moved at frightening speed and power underneath her - she could see things in the water, cars and logs and other chunky debris - so she jumped into the river to get the end over faster. As she hit the water she turned into a tea towel, which went all limp and flowed with the current without any resistance. I realised the river was what we all came from and what we all returned to. Earlier while the train-horse was traveling over the log I'd had a view of going over huge waves in the river - like we were on a roller coaster - and even got the same sensation in my guts you get on a roller coaster - the river was so huge and furious, like an ocean. Meanwhile I was working to detect the entity in power by working on some kind of 'spell' - to release a sequence of things to set in place e- like a key - that would somehow 'deactivate' it. Then I was in a hotel with a friend of mine (Kate), except the hotel looked a lot like my grandparents house in Werribee. We went back to the room we'd been staying in and realised we'd left the open fire going. Logs had fallen onto the carpet in front of the fire but mysteriously hadn't set everything on fire, though there were some large chunky embers near the door. Also I'd left the window up so I remember thinking that the combination of cold air and the fire had probably made the piano go out of tune. I was a bit cross Kate had left the room without screening the fire or shutting the window - I'd left the room before her. I didn't say anything though. I was given words to say about our / a breakup. I was watching a ball-shaped thing get rolled in hundreds and thousands, so it looked like a delicious donut but in fact they were spiders being sent out into the world (to infiltrate or kill). I was looking through a glass 'machine' that was both a nursery (where the spider balls were raised) and the machine from rolling them in hundreds and thousands. Then they shot off through tubes to wherever. Some kind of captured scientist had set it up and ran it. I wondered why he'd never been tempted to sabotage it. Then I was packing things and I had all this crap, notebooks, books, random stuff - I still had to finish packing and get off site before a due date - but it wasn't going well, partly because I couldn't concentrate and apply myself to the task. I came across a book that would help us escape.",591,2,2,0,2,2,1-sep.-20,0,46,1,1,0,2,3,3,4,5,3,4,2,3,1,25,52,27,21,92,2.4,2.57,4,1,2.03,11.59,0.51,1.35,0.51,0,0.51,0.34,0.17,0,0.99,0.99,17.77,8.97,0.47,0.47,13.71,9.14,4.57,0.73,0.73,DD_Report_pruned,1,4.74,1.86,0.17,1.69,0.51,15.57,11.51,0.17,0.68

Meanwhile someone at work had discovered an ancient elephant specimen preserved (intact) in an old bog - everyone was very excited because this was an amazing find and everyone would want to come and see it (once it was excavated and prepared) and thus save us financially.  Then I was at Parliament House in Canberra, looking at six sculpture's a friend's partner had made around the perimeter - supposedly recreating much older sculptures that used to be there. Five were figures made of stone, and one was a small three-story tower which I first described as made from smooth wood and metal, but when I got closer could see it was made out of two different metals - coppery on the outside and silver on the inside - in very organic shapes. I was just visiting, and as I left a friend and her sisters danced a goodbye song to me as I walked away, which I imitated. They were wearing strange balloony paper dresses.  I came to a house were I was staying with others - it was very messy, we were 'squatting' there while the owners were away. We had to pack up and leave very quickly because the real owners or tenants returned unexpectedly - we scrambled out the back door as they came in the front. One of the returning people called for her cat and worried because she couldn't hear her meow - I wasn't sure where the cat was but I knew she'd lost her tail (not violently, like she'd 'shed' or moulted) and felt bad.  Then the six of us were racing around the aisles in a store like Big W (sort of a lowbrow department store) - the store was empty of people (except us) but there were dinosaurs outside trying to get in. We knew that after six dinosaurs showed in a window, another would try and get through a big door into the store. We didn't have much of a plan to stop them getting in - just physically trying to hold the door closed.  Then this morphed into a musical, where the same people were ghosts and re-enacting the crucifixion. Then a live person came in the door (someone from TikTok who I'd been watching) and started watching and enjoying the performance too - the ghosts were surprised he could see them but pretended everything was fine. They gradually got closer and closer (the ghosts and the TikTok star) and I could see everyone had different teeth, the type of teeth showed what type of monster they were. I thought the TikTok star had pointy vampire teeth and wondered if there was going to be a fight.  Then I was sitting on the edge of bridge with someone unfamiliar to me and we talked and had a bit of a cuddle and smooch. A woman flirted with me and flashed her breasts and vulva - we smooched too. It was all quite lovely but in the back of my mind I was worried (for both of them) that they'd realise I wasn't very good at relationships.",538,3,2,0,2,2,1-sep.-20,0,46,1,1,0,2,3,3,4,5,3,4,2,3,1,25,52,27,21,92,2.4,2.57,4,1,3.53,25,1.86,1.49,1.67,0.74,0.74,0.37,0.19,0,1,1,20.26,10.04,0.55,0.55,14.13,9.67,4.46,0.77,0.78,DD_Report_pruned,1,4.28,1.86,0,1.67,1.67,13.2,13.01,0,0.74
150,159,0,,,9/14/20 16:57,14.09.2020,810,"Someone in our party or community had made a new device that travelled at super speeds - faster than the eye could see. It looked like a silver metal ball - maybe billiard ball size? Smaller than a tennis ball - and it was kind of like a mechanical virus. It travelled until it hit a person, embedded itself and then exploded, which sent out a number of new balls. A younger woman essentially became a suicide bomber by carrying on into a market or public shopping space, to deploy the first one. The resulting 'blast' flattened several people and then the little spheres lodged in them like bullets - so the people were definitely dead. Needless to say the spheres spread very quickly - they moved so fast there was no time for people to react or even realised what was happening My 'view' followed them as they spread down the road, at one stage reaching people at the snow and people on a ski lift, who started dropping off the lift seats as they were affected. I can't remember why we'd made this, let alone released it - though I do seem to remember the older woman hadn't really asked anyone else before she let the first one go. And I don't think we realised just how fast and deadly they would be. Modern transportation networks meant they spread even more quickly. When you got very close to the spheres and slowed them down it turned out they actually looked like hairy spiders. Eventually of course they came back around to our town - two citizens who'd left town previously came home, fearful of what was happening, and brought the 'virus' back within them. One of the pair was the younger man from 'The Boys' TV show. We were trying to figure out how to protect ourselves from the devices, which seemed a bit hopeless as we'd seen on TV they could cut through steel and space shuttles - but we'd found a narrow 'windshield' somewhere and aligned ourselves in a row behind it and waited A TV interview had somehow revealed what they 'wanted' - but I don't remember what this was We waited but the 'attack' didn't happen - but then, we thought, would we even know if it had? They moved too fast to see.

150,147,0,,,9/9/20 16:30,09.09.2020,750,"I made a dress in a gorgeous soft teal fabric - a kind of A-line shape with three-quarter-length sleeves - I sewed it really well and was very pleased with it but when I tried it on it was completely the wrong size and I couldn't pull it down properly over my bust. I couldn't figure out how I'd got it so wrong (though I hadn't made a toile). I was showing it to an old school friend and looking at the pattern again and realised I'd used some of the wrong pattern pieces in putting it together - there were pieces for a 'B cup' dress and pieces for a 'D cup' dress and I'd used a couple of each without realising there were two sets in the packet.  I thought about giving the dress to my Mum, though it wasn't really her style - I thought she'd look good in it. I'd also knitted a jumper, which I was showing to the same friend. She'd made one from the same pattern and though I'd done a good job and was pleased with mine but I liked hers better - she'd incorporated narrow vertical strips of colour into it that looked really good and also knitted three-dimensional mushrooms that came out of it (mine didn't have any mushrooms so I don't think this was in the pattern). Here's was sort of freer and more creative - mine was more 'by the book'.  I was trying to find some songs and videos on my phone but was unresponsive to my taps, or responded in the wrong way and I'd lose the song I just found (I wanted to add ones I'd found and liked to a playlist). I was getting really frustrated and was pretty much hitting my phone in anger (which in the back of my mind surprised me because I love my phone so much)  Meanwhile my sister had muted what was playing (I was casting it to the TV) - we were back in the living room of our childhood home in Canberra. She was using an app on her phone to try and learn more about the nightmares she was having. I was troubled she was having nightmares. We had a conversation about whether they 'crossed timezones', meaning that if you had a regular nightmare at 5am, in another timezone you'd have it at the time that aligned to 5am in your local timezone - or a panic attack if you were awake.  Then I was at a friend's parents' house who were arguing about staying in the town they were in. It was a new 'pioneer' town - her Mum didn't want to stay in a place so small but her Dad was adamant he wanted to stay, because he wanted to practice his father's trade and do things for the dead - build a place where they could rest, or make coffins, where they could be at least and where their family could bring them (while they were talking he was tracing some kind of machine pattern which had a feeder belt).  Later I got up (late) and went out and said happy birthday to my friend's Mum, who hugged me for a really long time - apparently the rest of her family (except my friend) had forgotten or not bothered. Her other children (I think there were three of them) were leaving with their Dad, so it would just be her and my friend left in the house. I knew she needed a lot of looking after.  Then I was watering vegetable garden plots. I had an excess of the special fish juice fertiliser in the watering can, so I watered someone else's seedling trays too.  Then I was trying to pack up a whole bunch of stuff of personal stuff I had at work - plastic bins full of boxes, a whole dolls house, bits of china etc - and I needed to get them back to my regular house. But because work was closed this would be tricky - I couldn't put all the boxes near the front entrance doors because they'd be visible to everyone through the glass and moving vans couldn't drive onto the plaza outside. So I negotiated to take them down to the loading bay instead. The security guard was reluctant, and told me there'd be a fee, but agreed to do it. Somewhere here we pulled two other guards out of a class they were in to help me - it was a spy class and they were really interested in it, so reluctant to leave - but they did come and help me. None of my stuff was packed properly, by the way, there were bits everywhere. I faffed around getting things downstairs and eventually one of the guards asked me very politely if I was finished and could they go back to spy class - I said yes of course and felt bad because they'd been missing such a great opportunity.",820,3,3,0,2,2,1-sep.-20,0,46,1,1,0,2,3,3,4,5,3,4,2,3,1,25,52,27,21,92,2.4,2.57,4,1,4.51,37.8,2.8,1.59,1.83,0.85,0.85,0.37,0.37,0,0.97,0.97,18.9,11.22,0.41,0.41,17.93,13.29,4.63,0.69,0.69,DD_Report_pruned,1,7.68,0.49,0.49,2.32,2.07,13.05,10.49,0.37,0.12

The works were supposed to have finished last month but the toilets were still closed and locked - though I tried the door anyway, it was bent inwards a little at the bottom where others had obviously tried to force it too. So I went looking for the least horrible of the other toilets that were open. There were all very open, small, cramped and dirty - e.g. I found one that had four toilets to a 'cubicle', and the sanitary bins were full to overflowing. The walls were kind of half-height so everyone could see everyone else. It looks like the toilets drained onto the floor and then into a drain in the middle of the floor so you couldn't put toilet paper into them because everything would clog up and get even more disgusting. So I put my toilet paper into the overflowing sanitary bin instead and touched some of the paper that was already in there as I did, which was disgusting. I was thinking of writing a letter to the Executive team about how bad the toilets were and how they really needed to be replaced - I started writing the letter in my head to form the argument - e.g. visitors would also be disgusted, so we needed new facilities and more regular cleaning - but at the same time I knew we had no money for upgrades so it'd be kind of futile.",273,1,3,0,2,2,1-sep.-20,0,46,1,1,0,2,3,3,4,5,3,4,2,3,1,25,52,27,21,92,2.4,2.57,4,1,4.03,9.61,1.47,2.56,1.1,0,1.1,0,0.37,0,0.92,0.92,20.88,10.99,0.39,0.39,10.99,6.59,4.4,0.65,0.66,DD_Report_pruned,1,4.03,0.73,0.37,0,1.47,12.45,11.36,1.1,0.73

I decided to walk to where I was going from the station, though it was 2-3 km away and I was carrying a large backpack. I walked along a country road that was parallel to the main road. At some point I decided to cut back onto the main road, so I walked down a side-street, passing a church. I remember that there were fields around me which were very lush and bright green. Then I decided to stop and get a kebab at a cafe that someone had recommended to me. There wasn't a menu except for a piece of paper on the counter that basically said choose chicken, lamb or vegetarian, and select your sides from the cabinet. I ordered chicken and the woman behind the counter put some chicken into a large takeaway container. I had wanted flatbread with it, but once she had put the chicken in the container I didn't like to ask, as I thought if I had bread it should have gone into the container first with the chicken on top.  I then went to choose my sides, but I couldn't see anything in the cabinet except tzatziki, so I asked for tzatziki. I really wanted hummus as well, but didn't know whether I was allowed to have hummus as well as tzatziki and for some reason didn't want to ask. The server then handed over my container and  took it to the till to pay. There was a generous amount of chicken, but it really just looked like roast chicken with tzatziki, not a kebab. Some slices of tomato had mysteriously made their way into the container as well. The girl at the till rang up the price which was $6.50. Since the pandemic I have been paying for everything by card, but when I looked in my wallet I saw there were a lot of coins in there so I decided I would use some of the coins to pay the $6;50 and I asked the girl on the till if that was OK. I then started counting out the coins. I wanted 3 $2 coins and a 50c, but every coin I took out turned out to be a foreign coin. I had an Indian coin and a Ugandan coin, and others. The girl on the till got bored with waiting for me to find the money and wandered off. While I was still looking for coins I glanced out of the window and saw it was pouring with rain, so I thought I might eat my kebab inside instead of going out and looked for a table. Then the girl came back and I gave up looking for coins and paid by card. The girl then asked me if I wanted to work over the weekend, delivering kebabs for the cafe. I seriously though about it for a while, but decided not to as I didn't really know the area and thought I would be too slow doing the deliveries. By then the rain had reduced to a drizzle so I went out anyway. I was just leaving when I realised I had forgotten my backpack, which I had left behind the door, so I picked it up. For some reason I didn't put it on my back properly, but carried it in a very awkward way by the strap. I walked back the way I had come, and saw the church again. Whilst walking I met a family with two or three grown-up daughters, who seemed quite well-heeled and were very loud. They were going to their holiday house, which I walked past as they went inside, and I heard one of them say ""be careful, this used to be our dentist's"". I started to think I was getting lost, so decided to cut back to the main road to get my bearings. On the way I saw a sign to Donnybrook.

The closest flooding was in the right lane, and it stretched maybe 10m, encroaching almost to the middle of the road. The flooding in the left lane started just the other side of the right lane flooding, so about 160-165m ahead.

She wasn’t interested in looking at the book.   I was teaching the girl how to take photographs, first I was getting her to take photos of a single colour, we took pictures of solid yellow, one that was pure purple and one of plain orange.

I agreed to take part but wondered how that would work as I’m away from the London studio, shielding in Wales,  but decided I could see how things worked out, maybe I could participate by zoom. I was surprised to be asked , together with a person who was partly my old friend Gail, partly a younger artist called Rachel Figuera. Most of this dream took place in a wide queue around a courtyard full of colourfully dressed people many of whom were studio neighbour artists. Helen had put some work up for our group exhibition. One piece was a long stick with a beautifully carved large head at one end and a tiny one at the other. There was a little bit of ink not coloured in properly, so I took a dab of ink on my finger and fixed it. I realised I had changed it, completely ruining it by painting a crude girl’s face on it, the girl looked a bit like Katherine, helen’s daughter. I wondered how to explain/apologise to helen , she was far away in the queue though so I didn’t have to explain immediately. I also moved another piece of Helen’s work, bamboo in a bottle with the root facing upwards- I turned it round so that the root would be in the water. I didn’t think Helen would mind. For the Saturday work discussion, I started making work, a painting on brown paper. I wanted to attach a small portrait to this and searched around for copper coloured pipe cleaners, or some copper wire or even some brown wool to attach it to the main work, but failed to find any of these. I went to look for Rachel to ask about logistics and found she had printed large beautiful black & white posters, and put a copy in everyone’s pigeonhole. My work was   going to be ok to talk about in the Saturday group though. Since it was autumn, and I would be making a presentation on a stage, I looked for an orange dress to wear. I only had a green one, but thought that would do. I was ready & prepared for the event, and had decorated the stage orange, now happening on Monday morning. I turned away from the stage, and opened a door to a small brightly lit cubicle off the main courtyard, where I had to clear up some rubbish. There was a sink and a toilet, I put some of the rubbish in each and poured buckets of water on top, but most of the rubbish stayed, so I looked around for scraps of paper to wrap it in, everything I found was too small or unsuitably shiny. I pulled the rubbish out, it was disgusting, smelly & slimy but not actually shit, more like rotting beetroot peel.

I hovered in the doorway and thought I cannot jump that.

He was wearing a long duster coat which swirled behind him and a canvas hat pulled very low. We were walking in a strange desolate landscape. It was a ochre light and the land was  vast and with dark compacted sand, no vegetation, very empty. Maybe it was a desert in India not Arabia because it wasn’t hot. Suddenly Sam started to walk faster and took off alone on another track which led him to disappear off to the right and quickly become a distant figure who didn’t respond to my calls. I carried on and a strange man-made feature appeared ahead of me. It was a high terraced construction about the area of a football pitch, slightly rectangular in its footprint. It stepped up in big stone walled terraces with flat sandy walkways as each travelled up, leading to a final terrace with a Parthenon like temple. It looked more like one of those ancient Indian palaces abandoned in the countryside than anything European or Arabic. I walked around the right hand side and as I did so, the sky became dark yellow and I couldn’t see at all. I had a yellow fog in front of my eyes and I struggled to find my way around the end of the temple complex and back towards the place I had started from. I was aware of the sound of water from the top of the construction. I had reached the end and there was nothing but an eery yellow glow when I bumped into an older man, bluff and hearty, who said he knew the way. We walked on and came to a hedge and could hear the sound of a busy road. We left the landscape and the fog cleared. A party of Indians followed us onto the road, they were heading for university. We stopped outside a house and a kindly older man with grey hair and an intellectual look invited us in. I was struggling to understand where we were and he said some place of two syllables beginning with M and I asked him to spell it out. The word ended in ‘cuit ’. The inside of the house was Natasha’s house, with lots of her things around, very cluttered but lovely things and I admired and picked up a miniature painted metal Victorian rocking crib with pink flowers on. The man was joined by another nice slightly younger man and the new one said we were outside a junction and you could go left or right for the town where I was staying. I said I’d rather take the right hand road and he said that would lead round to join the left hand road, waving his arms for emphasis. I was back in town, which was M.

I experienced the other guests as older than me but they looked middle aged - in their 50s and 60s - so I guess I was younger than I am now. I felt like an observer rather than a participant. As if I had not been invited as a friend but arrived by accident somehow. There was an atmosphere of sexual tension - one woman had auburn hair pinned up and was dancing with an older man. She was wearing a dark rich red/maroon coloured skirt. She slumped on a sofa and let her hair down then lifted her skirt so I could see her upper thighs then her pubic hair. I knew she was masturbating but I didn't see her touch herself.  Then I was on the shore in Argyll & Bute speaking to a young man. He had something to do with the ferry to Bute. He was wearing a mask so I could only see his eyes - they were blue but with very dark lashes and eyebrows. I thought he was handsome. He was wearing a very old fashioned light brown duffel coat of a type I  once wore. He spoke with a Scottish accent and misunderstood me for a tourist from England. I explained I had lived in Scotland for many years then started reminiscing about the party. He remembered stories about what used to go on in the big house on Bute and laughed about it. I showed him a book I had with pictures of the people at the party and we laughed at the clothes and poses.I told him about the Auburn haired woman and he said she probably thought you were gay.

There was a young woman smoking, She had her back to me but I knew she was not the person I was looking for but guessed she might be their daughter. There was a portrait of the person I was looking for on the wall. I knew who it was but also that they were dead. I wasn't upset or shocked. The woman was talking to another woman at first as if she was a customer but then I asked to see her work and it turned out she was an artist.

I found that if I lost concentration the broomstick dipped towards the ground and slowed down. I had to really focus to make it fly fast, straight  and fairly high - even so we were flying only about 8ft above the road and this seemed normal - as if everybody did it. A woman joined us. She was known to me. I didn't like her but I felt a connection with her. She was upset about something and I comforted her by putting my arm around her as we flew. She was wearing a soft black jacket which felt like sheepskin or some other warm soft animal skin type fabric. I decided I might like her more than I thought. I also was surprised that I could fly fast while talking to her and thinking about her instead of focusing on flying.

I stretched out sideways across the van which was much wider than it is in real life and was pleasantly surprised how wide it was. I then showed the person watching how I could sleep on the parcel shelf which was surprisingly comfortable.

We were carrying very heavy old fashioned suitcases without wheels. The seats were filling up so Cam rushed to put the suitcases on board while I found a compartment for us. After the train pulled out of the station we wanted something from our cases but when we went to get them there was a locked door between our carriage and the next. The door was green, scratched with graffiti. I kicked it in anger. The dream switched to home but not the home we live in now. We were talking about having to rent somewhere in London because I had found work there. But Cam had agreed a lease on somewhere tiny where there wasn't even room for a table. I was cross with him and we had an argument. I was worried about being stuck somewhere depressing - dark and cramped for months and paying for storage on our large table. I felt like crying but shouted at Cam instead. Then I was in a car travelling through Edinburgh. But I was also watching a film in which Alan Rickman was driving a car. I was both in the film and watching a film. It was unmistakeably Edinburgh but it was wreathed in smoke wafting in layers like mist.

Then I was telling a funny story to a friend about bumping into Emma Thompson and her mum having tea in a cafe. But while I was telling the story I was also in the cafe reliving that experience. Emma Thompson was wearing an off white woollen coat and matching dress. Her mother was elderly and looked like her but wasn't anything like her real mother. The cafe looked like someone's sitting room and I joked with Emma that the woman standing by the door who was dressed as waitress (apron, black skirt, white blouse) looked so surprised to see us that perhaps it was just her sitting room.

Saw it - it was Nissen hit style - an arch of corrugated metal with a brick front. It was nestled in a very bright green grassy field with a slight hill behind. Inside it was much bigger than it looked on the outside. It was cold but there was a woodburning stove but I did not understand how it worked. It was dark black metal box in the middle of the room with a very big metal chimney running up to the ceiling. Behind it there was a glass box with a fire in it. My partner seemed to know how it worked. He turned a handle and the fire in the glass box grew bigger and then he explained that the heat would trigger the fire in the more normal looking black metal stove. He warmed me to keep away from the heat and then a jet of hot air was released with a whooshing noise and I felt very warm. The room was well-furnished and very neat.

One was still being baked. It was a  flat chocolate sponge - a rectangle like a Swiss roll sponge but it was being baked under a silicone sheeet with wires leading to it which I understood to be a new way of baking cakes.  We didn't eat any and went inside. We seemed to know why we were there and now I felt like a detective looking for something and solving a mystery.  We went down some steps and opened a door. The room was only partially visible from the threshold. It was large and laid out like a gentlemen's club with deep brown leather sofas and armchairs. There were men in there but I could only see one. He was wearing a dinner jacket - black tie. He wore a mask. It was black and metallic green and covered his whole head like a ball making him look a bit like a fly - a shock by greeny blue blowfly or similar.  I felt afraid. He told us to leave and implied I was obviously in the wrong place because I was a woman. He didn't acknowledge Cam.  Cam and I retreated, turned a corner and stood with our backs to a wall. I said something derogatory about the man. I also said something about how we could come back and get into the room later. Then I heard the man's voice through the wall. There was an old metal grill in the wall crusted with yellowed paint and dust. I knew he had heard what I said and felt annoyed with myself for being caught out. The voice told us to leave and warned us not to try getting into the room again. I was frightened and remembered thinking this was something to do with dark magic.

I asked what the cat's name was and a woman I used to work with said 'Otago' but I wanted to call the cat Pablo.

We went down a very steep hill at Wollongong and went to pick up this guy who lived on a wharf. The guy who lived at the wharf told me that he had once wanted to be really muscly and bulky but he'd had an accident and realised it wasn't worth it. Now he lived in a shack by the wharf because he didn't care about money and possessions and the shack had only cost him $2000 to buy.

I was on a train or bus, and there were people getting on who looked like immigrants from India or Pakistan. They sat very close to me so I tried to get up and move and then wasn’t sure which seat to sit in. The train then seemed to become a boat, and I was sitting by the window with my bag of things. Then my bag fell into the water and I was super distressed as it had my phone and passport in it. I somehow jumped into the water and got the bag back. I then spoke to a male passenger, and I was looking on my phone for a place to stay in the small Dutch town I had found myself in. I said to him that I had a friend in Eindhoven but I wasn’t sure I could get there. I was writing a report for school or university, not clear what exactly. I was working with a girl I used to go to secondary school with and we were frantically trying to complete the project. We were also watching something on a laptop, it was a bald man in a pub and he was the bartender, and one point he was threatening one of the customers, but then the customer put ten pounds in his shirt and that diffused the situation. I was stuck between watching this, and rewinding the clips for my friend to watch, and then also focussing on writing the report. It was hand written and messy, and I was saying how we would have to rewrite it because it also contained some of our early ideas we weren’t using anymore.

There was some kind of revolutionary activity happening in the chemist warehouse in Surry Hills. Water or flooding was involved.  Dream 2 I was sleeping underwater in a series of different clips of underwater footage, there was one with a shark coming out from behind a rock.  Dream 3  I was running in a long distance running race. A dreary city’s backstreets. The guy running in front of me turned left but I climbed up over some kind of ledge through slabs of cement in disarray and into an old motel, high ceilings and dreary, backwater. I was directed to a room somehow where there were some older Middle Eastern Muslim men in a group watching something terrible that was happening on TV in a far off Middle Eastern country. They had their heads in their hands and couldn’t belive these people had done whatever it was that they had done again. It was catastrophic. On the TV some journalists tried to fly away in a helicopter and some middle eastern man propelled himself about 50 metres into the air to try and drag a journalist out of the helicopter. This was filmed from above the helicopter looking down, with a large group of rowdy people on the ground. I went upstairs to another room and my girlfriend Kelli was in there sitting on the edge of a bed at the far end of this big dreary room. She said it seemed to be raining inside and indeed there were puddles forming at her feet and water coming down in various spots. She said she was going to go to the bathroom. It was on the far side of the room to the left on the wall where I’d come in. When she was gone I quickly went to the old deep built in wardrobe to secretly check, although I was pretty sure there was no ritalin in there. The wardrobe was between the bathroom and the front door. To my surpise there was quite a lot in one long pack. As I was grabbing one, she came out of the toilet, I carried on what I was doing and pretended I wasn’t up to anything suss. She stood over me and said there was a woman in the bathroom, an older woman. I said ‘what?’ and i stood up, thought right this is my job to deal with and noticing i felt no fear i went in to check. I went into the old grey/green bathroom, with shower curtain and maybe steam from the hot shower but there was no one in there. I came back out telling Kelli that and the ritalin tablet I thought I had i must have dropped and it turned out to be an old brown partly shrivelled grape on the floor. I walked across a backyard that had similar old style stone work to that which appeared in the park, from one group of people to another part of a house, or a stand alone done up shed. In there was Nikki. I was surpised to see her here and I decided to go straight to the heart of the matter and said ‘how did your IVF turn out, did you get a baby?’ She said she would answer in the style of one of my answers and began singing something. I think she meant offence but I decided to join in the singing and came in at the end, to my pleasant surprise, in perfect harmony. Kelli’s mum was sitting at the table eating and I made a joke about ‘what it would take to take those potato gems off you’?

The van was surrounded by about seven or eight high school students, male, seniors, 17 years old or so. They WERE all looking trough the window of the van. My female partner was playing a game of some description on her phone. I'd been making a video clip for a famous indie folk singer previously. Someone asked me what I was doing it for - the same woman who was playing the game in the car. I said to her 'just let me do it my way.I'll do it for the reasons I want.' One of the schoolboys said to me a little smartly in reference to the clip -'what are you doing? You like the band do ya?' Trying to patronise me as being I guess old and not with it. I took the friendly approach and jumped into the driver's seat. I was aware there was a lot of these kids.

Then two middle aged men walking in a paddock in conversation looking down tv overlay news/current affairs style, filmed on a long lens, one of them with curly more white than grey hair, the other the reporter in a suit. The curly white haired man saying he learnt a lot from the animals. He said at the age of 48 he had found himself wearing a snout. A snout was a brilliant thing animals had devised to filter things. the snout he had was made of hard grey material with felt on the outside, stuck out maybe 15 centimetres, covered his lower face in much the same way as a face mask. And he said it is also of course known by it’s other name ‘a Seminar’. This was like the Latin technical name, or what the experts referred to it as. It had ceased being a tv show somewhere along the line and I was on his property or involved. It was night. Maybe 4am. I went out to see his cows. There was soemthing remarkable about them. They’d learnt something. To think as a group or work as a group or something. I got out to this paddock. I was with girlfriend Kelli who I think was in a shopping trolley I now had to the side in front of me. This group of black cows, maybe 12 of them or so, all of them standing perfectly still maybe three, four metres or two cow lengths of me, they were so black only their silhouette could be seen in the night. There was perhaps a light mist. They were silent also. Still as a painting. A formation. They were different sizes, and not in a straight line but a group, some of them back slightly further so that the outline was uneven but also composed like a painting. I said ‘they look like a gang’.

Me and him had some kind of falling out or I was just like enough’s enough. He was sure that anyone who fell out with him was losing out. He was more like a gangly sinewy teenager than a man. We had been working together on something for awhile and I said ‘you’ve taught me some stuff, but now you have to get out, now fuck off, fuck off Donald get out of here!’ I told him No Donald you can go.

Karryn went to call the cops on her mobile and Donald suddenly lashed out and stabbed one of the guys in the chest with I think a fork. The guy went ‘wo’ and stumbled and then fell on to his back on the lawn Donald started gloating saying he had no feeling at all, no regret, he was going to kill everyone on the way out. He was getting right down low, no friends in the world. There was something very sad about the scene. And then one of the guys lashed out and stabbed Donald back and Donald fell down on the lawn.

What an idiot you’d  been for not buying it.’ It was the house nextdoor to my childhood that she was talking about, the one Donald was stabbing someone on the lawn in front of.

They would take them back and I would get a bus home. I started to walk but went the wrong direction so I went back to the pub. I knew I would miss my bus. Then the car wasn't working so we had to carry everything out again. They said they would come back and tidy before opening the next day.  I tried to ring a taxi but the phone wouldn't work.  Then another couple came out said they needed a taxi. Then I got a phone call from someone who I think had phoned me in another dream offering me a job.

I got dressed putting on lots of different layers. There were quite a few people about. I said there's always people about. I felt a little irked. I wanted them to understand  it was my house. Then I started a conversation with an elderly man about a previous lodger. I took him on a tour of all the rooms. Some i recognised or remembered some i didnt. In one room he pulled back the curtain halfway and i glimpsed a city. He said what was my favourite view. I struggled to recall anything but remembered and said when I lived in Sheffield I loved the view of the city at night with all the lights on so i suppose its the Isame.  I said i had the time to show him round because I didnt have to start work if I didnt want to until ten.  Then we were outside walking past  different buildings and appeared to be in the countryside.. We walked on and came to a children's school and then turned back. Then there was a ymca building, then a wood with keep out. I said it was probably  used for military training. He went in the wood and after a few minutes some territorial army asked him to leave. We continued back to the house. I had an idea for the house. I said I would like it to be a craft centre where people would stay for a short while work on their crafts. We would have a visitor centre where they could sell their work if they wanted, the man said I would have to work out the finances, make a plan . He said he knew people we could approach for this.  We got back to the house. There was conversation about someone going to a wedding  of the man whom she had loved. Then i suggested that a murder mystery might be fun. I said you can download it for free. We went into a room with lots of strange old keyboards that were difficult to use. My friend Carole. The letters were tiny and odd. I struggled to write the search terms and Carole was irritated with me but eventually  managed. Then we went towards the house again as I needed to  get some money. I told him and another that they should go into Darlington and get a printer and some A4 paper. There was some blue paper by the keyboards but it wasn't ours

I walked up shiny wooden open stairs and helped a young girl to tidy up...she was folding her dolls clothes really beautifully then we were about to go downstairs when I realised I couldn't because I had strong vertigo...started to panic...told the girl and she put her doll at the top of the stairs and slid it down what I realised was a slide. They both went down and I then had confidence and was able to walk down easily. The father then came in the door and said Hallo Greta to me, and I told him my real name.

I could see lots of people outside the window.

We went for a walk..took food..and instead of our city it turned into a lovely countryside..dusty ground. I noticed their daughter was crying and unhappy and saying she had a bad headache. I told Peggy and she said she'd be fine and to keep on walking, but her daughter lay on the ground, so we went back. We moved to the side of the pathway to let other people pass.

They were uncomfortable. I wondered what it was.Graham was making strange jokes. I showed him my paintings which he said he liked.

I wanted to know what her daughter was now studying. Her daughter was in my mind, I had an image of her wearing a plain beige dress that just hung on her like a sack. I did not see her face.  Later, we were standing by my old house and I was playing a recording of two of my children playing with a friend in the snow in Oslo. The recording must have been 12 years old. I felt the presence of my eldest child at his current age and we laughed a lot.  Suddenly, my two children were young again and in my dream. We were still in London, but it was covered in snow and looked like Oslo. A woman and child were with me and I guess they were my friend and her daughter. Then we bumped into another old friend and his son. the child had a massive piercing on his lip and in his ear. He was, perhaps, 12 years old. I made a big fuss of him and told him how cool he looked. I also told my friend that I was envious that he had been brave enough to do that and that I wanted my children to have piercings. But at the same time I was really feeling that my friend had issues and should not have done that to his child.  I felt very close to my male friend.

It was essentially about general knowledge questions with a choice of six answers that were flashed up on the screen. One of the questions was ‘What was special about a set of mountains that were called the Giant Mountains?’ I made some smart joke that was clever and everyone laughed. But then my eldest son knew the real answer and said they could be seen from space. Suddenly, I was in space with a group of astronauts (4 or 5). We were floating very far away from the Earth and I had a sense that I had joined an ongoing conversation. They were discussing the answer to the Giant Mountains question and trying to identify where it was on Earth. They pointed it out and then started showing me other landmarks on Earth that could be seen from space. One of the astronauts (a man) said that what he liked most about being on the moon (I suddenly noticed we were floated near the moon but not standing on it) was that he could see the whole of the Earth. It was then time for us to return to Earth. We did this through a free fall. At first this was exhilarating but as we got closer, I started to worry about how we would pass through Earth’s atmosphere. I thought to myself that the body I was in had gotten out to space and so there must be a plan for getting back (I was aware it wasn’t my body). So I just relaxed and suddenly we were approaching the ground. I decided that I would trust the body to know what to do as I saw the other astronauts pulling at parachute straps and landing on the ground. My body did the same thing. Then as we all took off our helmets, I saw that the astronauts were a group of men and one woman. The dream suddenly became black and white.

I could see that it had got caught on the wall below the seat. The seat must have been above the wheel because the blanket was getting dragged in as the wheels of the bus turned. The man did not notice what was happening at first but I could see it tightening around his neck. Then he realised that he was been dragged through the mesh and to the undercarriage of the bus.

We even had to go back for a second viewing as he promised to make changes. As we stepped on the carpet (which was made of grass) it felt wet because he had just cleaned it.

A man was making a meal for us all - I could see he was cooking loads of pasties and Findus crispy pancakes in the oven, along with various other things. I saw that he was grilling something but was resting the hot grill pan on one of my pillow cases whilst cooking. I shouted at him, how dare he use my pillowcase to cook something hot on. At some point I had opened windows in various rooms, but then there was a thunderstorm which became a hail storm with massive pieces of hail, so I had to go and shut all the windows. It was the last night of holiday and we were planning to go out. My nan said she wanted to go to the pub, where there was live music or karaoke, so she could sing along. I think she had already got dressed up. I was surprised because my nan had dementia and rarely even talked, and hadn't dressed up for years, but I thought she might enjoy it, and that I might also take my aunt.  Later I was in a theatre awaiting the start of a show. I was there with my mum, my sister and someone else. I had arrived at the theatre on a bus. I was with someone on the bus. We had to get the bus one way past the theatre, then wait for it to come back the other way; I wondered whether it would still be the same driver and whether he'd notice we'd just got off the bus in the other direction. When we got to the theatre we had to ring the bus bell at exactly the right time, then the bus stopped immediately; it stopped in an exact place between 2 of the huge letters outside the theatre that spelled the name of the production. Inside the theatre foyer there was a big U shape of red comfortable seats; the walls were black. We had a long time to wait before the show. I ordered something from the person serving - they said there was a good offer on 4 drinks, which I planned to get later - and asked for a programme. They said the programme was only 2 sides, it was just a piece of pink paper printed double-sided in black and white. On it there were very short, scathing reviews about all the previous plays that the actors had been in; I mentioned this to mum when I gave her the programme to read. At some point, Barbara was there and decided to show the foyer staff how she would perform the lead role - I think the play was My Fair Lady. She flounced dramatically up and down the foyer, explaining how she would have got the part and/or doing some lines from the play, and gave all the staff a flyer/resume about herself. For one of the staff, she produced and handed over a larger folder or book full of big photos of her in previous productions. I had intended to change my clothes once I arrived at the theatre but by the time all this had happened I didn't have time to change before the play started. I looked down and was wearing a long dress over some smart trousers, so looked ok but a bit odd. I asked my sister whether she still intended to change before the play.",591,3,3,0,1,3,7-sep.-20,1,44,1,1,1,3,3,3,2,2,3,2,3,4,2,31,84,31,14,114,2.4,2.71,5,5,2.37,48.6,2.03,0.17,0.51,0.34,0,0,0,0,1,1,16.92,8.29,0.43,0.43,14.21,10.66,3.55,0.71,0.72,DD_Report_pruned,1,6.09,1.18,0.17,2.88,0.34,14.21,11.51,0,0.68

He was the sort of guy I would have fancied in my 20s, very skinny, dark hair  - sort of tousled and messy and sticking up a bit, cheeky face, I was aware at the time he was a bit young for me. I was wearing a t-shirt from a festival with a list of the bands that played. He was looking at it and knew all of the cool bands that were on there, including one called 'Gul' which I had never heard of It wasn't the cool bands that I had been to the festival to see and he must have guessed this, so he said he also liked the Stylistics, who were also listed on the t-shirt. I thought I was well in there with this guy but then he started to talk to another girl and arranged to meet her tomorrow. She went off somewhere while me and the guy went and sat down at a dining table, which seemed to be in his house. The other girl came over and I thought the guy was going to lie and say I was someone from work, and that I would leave if he did. We put some paperwork onto the table anyway to give that impression. However, he very honestly told the girl that he was seeing me today and her tomorrow, and they both seemed fine with that but I was less convinced, although I  thought that must be just what people do these days and I should go with it. During his conversation with her, I accidentally knocked over a glass of his homemade pink lemonade, which went all over the paperwork and I hurriedly tried to mop it up before he noticed. The guy came back alone. We had been playing a board game of some sort and I presumed we would continue with that. But he said he had only pretended to be playing, or had just set the board up randomly, so he put the game away. He obviously didn't want to waste time with board games. I moved to a rocking chair and he sat on my lap. We started kissing, which quickly became very passionate. With my arms around him I could feel how skinny he was.

We randomly arrived at a ferry port and Vanessa suggested we should just get on a ferry and see where we ended up. We got onto a ferry with no idea of where it was going. We felt very excited and impulsive, although I was a bit anxious because I remembered that I hadn't changed my clothes since the previous day and I also hadn't cleaned my teeth. I looked in the shopping bags I had with me and saw there were some clothes I could put on, although they weren't clean either. We enjoyed the excitement of being on a ferry to an unknown destination and speculated about what country we might end up in. After a while the ferry pulled into a dock where it would be waiting for an hour and we got off to go home and pick up more stuff. Around this time we found out that the ferry was actually going to a lake in the UK, we looked up some information about it and it looked nice but obviously not as exciting as going to a different country. I went home to get some clean clothes etc then headed back to the ferry port to continue the journey. When we got back on the ferry, a woman with a child had taken over the area that we were sat in before and the child was setting up to take over the floor area to play in. I felt annoyed that someone with a child had presumed they were entitled to take over the best seating area on the ferry. I pointed this out to them and showed them where I had created a pretend lake and castle on the floor, to indicate that adults may also want to have a play area and they weren't just for kids.",322,4,2,0,2,2,7-sep.-20,1,44,1,1,1,3,3,3,2,2,3,2,3,4,2,31,84,31,14,114,2.4,2.71,5,5,3.73,59.17,3.11,0.62,1.86,1.24,0.62,0.31,0.31,0,1,1,20.19,7.76,0.54,0.54,15.22,10.87,4.35,0.77,0.77,DD_Report_pruned,1,4.97,4.35,0,0,1.55,17.7,11.18,0,2.17

Not sure if I was the woman at some points, definitely most of the time I was watching her - she was blonde, perhaps looked a bit like Britney Spears. At one point the man made her lug around a load of really heavy stuff that was tied to her back, so that as she walked she was stooped over and could only move very slowly. All the time it was dark, late evening in a seedy cityscape. She lugged the stuff to outside a cinema or theatre. At this time my viewpoint changed to seeing the city and characters as if they were on a board game. To help the woman, I put 3 lengths of spring onion in various places outside the theatre as barriers (on my board game version) - from the woman's perspective these were big, like bollards. The woman lugged the stuff round into a different street, where there were several contortionists. One female contortionist was demonstrating a new technique to make yourself pretty much flat, possibly to fit inside a flat cardboard box. It involved kneeling on your own shoulder so that it became flat - it looked very painful. Other contortionists watched and tried this.  Later, I was part of a whole group of people lined up who had to do a physical task - I think to avoid something bad happening. There were about 20 of us - some of whom were my friends - lined up side-by-side. In front of each of us was allegedly a set of monkey bars and we needed to cross from one side to the other and back within a certain time. The bars were different for everyone and mine was not a set of bars at all, it was just one hand ring on a very short rope placed quite high up and a long way from me. I tried to figure out how I could get to the ring to swing off it - I would have to leap from where I was and hope to catch it - and how I was meant to go anywhere during the task with only a single ring that didn't swing anywhere. I asked a friend next to me to ask the people running it whether that was correct. They brought me a big paving slab up on its side and put it in front of the ring as if that should help me to do the task. I saw that my friend Suzie was preparing to do the task after me and was dressing up for it with lots of jewelled accessories. I went over and gave her a jewelled hairband to wear for the task.",460,1,4,0,1,2,7-sep.-20,1,44,1,1,1,3,3,3,2,2,3,2,3,4,2,31,84,31,14,114,2.4,2.71,5,5,1.52,22.96,0.87,0.65,0.65,0.22,0.43,0,0,0,1,1,15.87,7.83,0.42,0.42,15,9.13,5.87,0.71,0.71,DD_Report_pruned,1,5,0.65,0.43,2.17,0.43,17.83,9.57,0,0.87

There was a big room like a restaurant but I think it was my mum's house. There was a big long raised table in the middle then loads of other tables around the outside. All of the tables were laid very meticulously with fancy place settings, cutlery and very particularly-shaped matching wine glasses. I had to get another wine glass for myself for some reason and went to a big cupboard with loads of wine glasses in it, all different shapes, sizes and colours. There weren't any the same as the ones on all the tables so I picked up a yellow one that was a bit bigger. Some other people were also getting new/more wine glasses but they all picked a dainty little orange one so I thought I should do that too so I didn't look greedy.  Possibly in the corner of the same room/party, but possibly not, my friend Rach was running the wine bar. All the wines were French. Rach was finding a wine to go with the meal and asked someone how long it would take to get a particular wine ready. It would be too long a wait so she said ""we'll go with les bananes"" instead - I was horrified at the idea of a banana wine because I hate bananas. I saw some huge wine bottles in the bar area (probably 8x normal size) and at some point some posh teenagers came in who were staying in the vineyard. Later I was on holiday somewhere exotic, or at least somewhere novel. I was staying in a fairly rudimentary, possibly wooden, lodging with numerous other people, a mix of my friends and some strangers - possibly all sleeping in the same large room. everyone decided to get up at 2am to see the light at that time of day - it was either approaching dawn, or somewhere where it barely got dark. We all stood up and looked out of our lodging across to the village and could see the buildings silhouetted against a pale light - it was very pretty, although I was not impressed to be up so early. We all walked into the village to appreciate it some more. I then presumed everyone was going back to bed, which I wanted to do, but all my friends intended to stay up and out for the rest of the day now. I wanted to go back to the lodging as I wanted more sleep and wasn't properly dressed or with the stuff I needed for the day. I was wandering around trying to find transport back to the accommodation. At some point someone I was with started talking to a man who said he had found some transport back to wherever we were going.

Kate took us into the building to show us where she worked. I spoke to some of her colleagues, including a young woman who was very nice and friendly.

I arrived in a group of about 6 friends but most people had arrived ahead of us so we had to split up over several tables. This part of the reunion was in one of our old classrooms, as if we were recreating an actual class. After I had been there for a while, I realised that everyone else was wearing our school uniform and I felt I was the only person who wasn't. By coincidence I had chosen to wear a yellow checked shirt, which was similar to the blue checked shirt of our uniform. My old school friend Miranda delighted in making fun of me for not realising we were all meant to wear the uniform and suggested there were other things planned that I had failed to prepare for, e.g. that we were all going to have a class photo. At some point after that we had a karaoke session in the classroom. A few people I didn't recognise stood up to sing. I noticed that they weren't wearing the uniform either - they were wearing very bright shirts, perhaps African or Caribbean-style designs. They gave me an approving nod or other gesture for not wearing uniform so I felt less alone. A very small girl/woman also wanted to sing, and I recognised that she was Nicky from school, who had always been tiny and unfairly picked on when we were at school. Miranda or someone else showed me a timetable with all the things we were meant to be doing that day - there were various different groups of classmates indicated by 4-letter codes but I wasn't sure which one I was meant to be in. We visited a haunted house attraction. When I went in I recognised one of the people working there as a real ghost, apart from here he looked more normal and less scary, like a normal human, so I told him so.",337,2,4,0,2,2,7-sep.-20,1,44,1,1,1,3,3,3,2,2,3,2,3,4,2,31,84,31,14,114,2.4,2.71,5,5,3.26,23.99,1.78,1.48,0.89,0.59,0.3,0.3,0,0,1,1,20.47,9.79,0.45,0.45,16.62,12.46,4.15,0.72,0.73,DD_Report_pruned,1,6.53,3.56,0,0.89,0.89,14.54,16.02,0,2.08

I seemed to be in everyone's way. At one point I managed to get myself stuck between people who were either getting plates, or passing plates between them - people were having to get plates out of somewhere and pass them to another person, and I seemed to be sandwiched between the 2 people making it very difficult for them to pass the plates but I was stuck and couldn't move. I carried on looking for someone I knew and at some point saw a colleague I knew from a long time ago - he looked like a cross between Sasha from Holby City and Dave; I was pleased to see him and went to chat to him whilst walking alongside him. He had gone up in the company since I last saw him and whilst walking with him I accidentally walked into the Board meeting he was going into. I got told off by a Board member and asked to leave. At some point after that I saw Helen. I trailed her around for a bit but she didn't say anything to me. When I left her, disheartened, I overheard her say to someone else ""I wish she'd leave me alone!"" I felt lonely and tired. I sat down at a cafe table and fell asleep with my head on the table. When I woke up, I looked at my phone to see something to cheer me up but my phone just kept playing videos of shower heads, which was very distressing - I felt even my phone was against me.

Evidently we'd all decided to take turns to cook and had each bought stuff to make a dinner one night. I had bought mini kievs and chips. For some reason I'd taken the mini kievs out of the freezer but then not cooked them straight away and had left them in the packet intending to cook them later. I could see in the packet that some of the filling had oozed out and they weren't looking too tempting. My sister told me in no uncertain terms that she would not eat them. I was angry at her criticism and I made a rude comment about my family (with a bad swear word). My sister gloated at me criticising the family, whereas she would never do that. She showed me a cupboard where she had bought about 20 jars of curry paste, presumably to make dinner when it was her turn. Later I was driving into town. I stopped at a T junction in the middle of town but it was very difficult to see if it was clear either left or right. I had to edge forward slowly and quite a long way to be able to see. Meanwhile there was someone in a black car over the road revving the engine as if they were getting bored and going to drive straight at me. When I turned right, there were pedestrians walking all over the road, who were out and about in town. I thought town didn't look very safe with all these people and felt a bit nervous. I arrived at a cafe and put my coat on a seat then went to order at the counter. I was first at the counter when I got there, but while I was looking at the menu, another woman came up next to me and got served ahead of me. Then more people kept arriving, queued behind the woman next to me and kept being served ahead of me. The servers were asking 'has anyone ordered cake' and everyone who had was served ahead of me because I hadn't pre-ordered and didn't want cake. The menu I was looking at had lots of interesting mini lunch options but then I saw that this menu was for ""MM Club"" members only, so I didn't know what stuff I could order. Eventually I got fed up of people being served ahead of me, said something about it angrily to the server and walked out. I found my friend Rach and she suggested we went to a different cafe/bar. At this point I was starting to feel a bit unwell - dizzy possibly. Rach took me to a bar that I thought I recognised in my dream. You had to go into at the bottom/lowest level of the bar and it suddenly opened out above you, a bit like a theatre with raked seats. I remember the paintwork was a very unappealing mid-brown colour. At some point Rach showed me a photo where someone had put lots of makeup on her, it was very glamorous but looked odd because it was a sort of Indian-style makeup look, e.g. a bit Bollywood, but Rach is white.",556,2,4,0,2,2,7-sep.-20,1,44,1,1,1,3,3,3,2,2,3,2,3,4,2,31,84,31,14,114,2.4,2.71,5,5,2.7,6.34,0.54,2.16,1.44,0,1.44,0.18,0.9,0,0.94,0.94,20.32,8.81,0.28,0.28,16.37,12.05,4.32,0.61,0.61,DD_Report_pruned,1,8.45,0.36,0.36,1.44,1.08,15.11,12.77,0.9,1.26

I had just come back from somewhere else and already had some stuff packed into a large wheeled suitcase, but I noticed I still had lots of other belongings unpacked, including some birthday presents, so packed some more bags, overflowing with stuff, as quickly as I could. One bag was an open shopping bag full of books; a random man said he was offended by my books because he was Jewish and tried to spill them or get me to leave them. Once I'd gathered my stuff I went to queue at a lift with other people to get out of the building; we were pleased that this lift was not as busy as others in the building. I looked over the edge of the lift - it was an open lift and it was a very long way down, it looked like you could fall out of it and possibly some people were. I got in the lift, when it got to the bottom it started travelling horizontally, more like a bus or train, taking us away from wherever we'd been. I stayed on the lift/bus until it stopped, which was sooner than intended. I got out into a strange town with a friend, who at this point looked like Jenny. We walked through the town trying to look inconspicuous, everywhere there were people looking dispossessed or threatening, it was very apocalyptic. I thought we were being followed by someone who wanted to hurt us but realised it was a local beggar, who was either lame and/or blind. My friend found a local monument, a big brown stone monument that had a fountain and a pool and I recognised it from a holiday guide as the highlight of this town. But now it was full of dirty water, with homeless people/refugees sleeping around it and bathing in it. I said to Jenny to get out of there. We made friends with the blind/lame beggar, although he couldn't really speak. I worked how to ask him, in simple language and gestures, where to go when you want to hide and we followed where he led. I had to run after him and jump onto a bus/coach as the doors were shutting. The coach driver said I could stay on the coach if i filled in a whole bunch of surveys, which I was happy to do. The beggar took us (via the coach) to an obscure cafe. The beggar was now magically female and possibly had turned into Jenny B, whereas Jenny B had turned into my friend Vanessa. I was following them into the cafe and looking for them. I passed some men who were talking about Dubrovnik but it quickly became apparent that they were on the lookout for newcomers/refugees to harass, so I moved on and found Jenny B and Vanessa at a table. Jenny B had got us all food - one plate was breakfast, with eggs etc, another was something else - she'd also got us 2 bottles of wine.",535,2,5,1,1,2,7-sep.-20,1,44,1,1,1,3,3,3,2,2,3,2,3,4,2,31,84,31,14,114,2.4,2.71,5,5,2.99,7.01,0.75,2.24,0.75,0.37,0.37,0,0.19,0,0.97,0.97,19.07,8.04,0.49,0.49,16.26,10.65,5.61,0.73,0.73,DD_Report_pruned,1,5.05,2.06,0.37,1.31,1.12,16.07,12.52,0.37,0.37

We just stared at each other for a moment, and I smiled and he walked away and went upstairs to where the band was playing.

I was so happy tp be there, but my excitement was echoing around the place much more than it would in real life. I had to be quiet, my voice was bouncing around as if it was a massive empty chamber. There was a large clock/writing desk. Its main drawer was full of brand new mid brown closed zips in bunches, and loose, tumbling about the drawer. amongst the zips was a tacky watch, it was plasticky and jewelled, slightly broken, someone had stuck a glittery bindi on it. I shut the drawer. Outside the library it became confusing, a country village that morphed into a place I used to live in another european country. There was a minor celebrity there, a woman who was very fond of dogs. Someone said she was a bit silly, and thought that if she whistled, a dog would come to her. But she really did have this gift, and lots of friendly happy dogs started to appear, and she was very happy. But one of the dogs was an old one that remembered me. It had a grey muzzle, and was on a rope, tied to the side of a building. It growled and snarled at me, and I could't go anywhwere near it. It's owner was dead, and had died soon after our affair had ended, and he had his grave on the same land, buried by one man, alone. I struggled to recall his name, but after a moment or two i did remember it. A quayside appeared, with deep water all around, lots of people drinking and eating at benches. I stepped onto the jetty, over the water, but it was unstable, and a pod of whales swam right underneath, causing a wave and i fell into the water with a girl. she might have been my daughter when she was younger. we sank down, but were ok, we could breathe under the water and i remember thinking that this was not usual, and being aware of each breath i took, and feeling it in my lungs and being cautious. we saw a strange fish swimming, and then a mermaid swam toward us and i was disappointed because it was not a real mermaid, but a sort of disney cartoon type character. she caught the fish and ate it from the head down, and offered us the tail portion. we tried to eat it but it was disgusting. the mermaid laughed and swam away to her mermaid friends who also laughed at us, but it wasn't malicious, they were just playing around. Then we saw a whale with a long nose - a bottle-nosed whale i think, moored to the side of the Rainbow Warrior ship. But the whale also became an animation and we were part of a strange animated movie about the whale who took the Rainbow Warrior on a quest to save the planet. There were also two little boys, identical twins, on the ship, messing about, almost going overboard, but i knew that this was written into the plot. I was annoyed that the twins had been cast as white, then I looked carefully at them, and it seemed like they were chosen because they might have seemed dual heritage east asian/white to some people, but I knew this was a cynical move by racist directors and i was annoyed about it.

I had a distinct feeling of her leading me around the water park and having to hurry to keep up with her. We didn't interact other than her leading me and going first down the slides.  There were 5 slides in total. All were long - longer to go down than they looked like they should be. All but the final slide were tunnel water slides and had twists, turns and drops to keep on edge. There was a feeling of slowing down and speeding up randomly. On one slide we (Leanne and I would go down simultaneously with her just in front) caught up with a loud, middle aged man at the bottom of the slide.  The pool areas were very busy and we had to dodge people as we walked out of the shallow areas of them. It seemed that the water park was on the border between England and Scotland. One woman was apologising to her child and explaining that she had to go back to Scotland in an ominous way, before handing her child over to a nanny in a full Mary Poppins outfit. The nanny then began wading into the pool asking if the child was having fun.  The last slide had a huge queue and I remember there being two small children behind us. They knew my name and kept asking me questions. Eventually I saw that the slide was a huge toilet bowl with 32 large, black slides next to one another down to the drain in the middle which took a sharp left turn and then dumped you in the pool. I was worried that we would all hit into one another in the middle as the slides went straight down into the drain.  We got to the front and the slide operator was overly familiar, telling me to pick a slide. I was the 31st and assumed the two children behind me were together so thought I would be the last allowed on but apparently they weren't and one of them was next to me. I lost sight of Leanne.

I adjusted the driving seat which was too far back - I looked at her and thought she was not very tall for the driving position. Next, we were driving along a road close to where I was born and lived until I was 8.

I was looking for the hotel where I was staying but couldn't find it. Eventually, I found an old hotel but couldn't find reception. I went up and down different staircases and stopped at a bar and asked for reception. She told me that the bar was reception. I told her my name and and older man with a large hearing aid asked me a question but I couldn't understand him. He gave me a small, plastic covered card with the number 90 handwritten on it. I then went to the top of the hotel where room 90 was but there was a family in the room and blocking the doorway. I said this was my room but they said no - I looked at their card and it was a badly written 40 which I showed them and they went downstairs. Next.

Next I have acquired 2 children - 1 a toddler who is a relative and a baby. We start to walk home, me carrying the baby. The toddler points out an owl on a garage roof but as I look I can see it is a small dog but then a large black dog comes running out of the house barking but we run into the street and it stops. Then the owner and 2 other members of the family come out and ask me what I was doing. I explain about the owl and he says yes there is a baby owl just hatched being looked after by the animal.

We were in a bedroom, like a hotel room, and kind of sitting up on the bed, and I was wearing a top or T shirt and some knickers with my laptop on my lap. There were lamps on. The form was some kind of application and I was doing it for another boy, not my son, but it was hard because it was all in a language I don’t speak. There was a text box to fill in with a list of something and at the top of the box was a word meaning HOME or RESIDENCE, but then a tick box at the bottom, and when I ticked it the page reformatted to have two text boxes forming two columns, and one was HOME and one was WORK (both  in a language I don’t know) - the word for work was something like ERZATT. I thought the boy whose form it was should probably do the form filling for himself because it would require detail I didn’t know, or because it was looking like a large job I shouldn’t have to make time for, or was just a drag. And I wondered if my son’s form was needing the same level of detail and what should go in the boxes, and then I remembered for work he had some churches he’s played the organ for and they could go in there if we could remember them all.",478,2,2,0,2,3,1-sep.-20,1,52,1,0,0,5,5,3,4,4,4,4,3,5,1,24,52,47,19,100,2.4,2.57,1,2,1.05,28.62,0.84,0.21,0.42,0.21,0.21,0,0,0,0.91,0.91,19.04,12.97,0.31,0.31,13.81,10.04,3.77,0.61,0.61,DD_Report_pruned,1,6.49,1.05,0,1.46,0.42,12.97,9.83,1.05,0.63

In my mind’s eye I could see they were able to go swimming there as well. I wondered if it was my GP as it seemed familiar and then I remembered that I actually had been allowed to store a lot of the stuff from my studio in the basement at my GP’s. One of them had said I could and so I had, even though the rest of them probably didn’t approve. I realised that it must all still be there as I’d forgotten to retrieve it all when I moved in to my current, larger place. I wondered if it would still be there and if I should go there and sort it all out, but I wasn’t sure whether I should bother. The person I was talking to said I might be able to take their studio over. We looked for an ad about it in a local magazine, which actually has become defunct but she had the next couple of issues that would have been published if it had kept going. One wasn’t bound and the pages were just held together in an unglued bundle, and the other I’m not sure, but it was unfinished in some respect. There were articles about artists that would never be published, which seemed sad although I was secretly satisfied. I started to head over to my GP surgery, but instead went to her studio and the entrance seemed to be on the edge of a car park. It was dark as it was very much in shadow, whereas it had been sunny where I was before.

While we were talking, a stray cat miaowed outside the front door and I opened it and encouraged it in. It was small and tawny brown with white patches. I tried to pick it up and held it quite firmly as I didn’t want it to run off into the house and be hard to find. It looked a bit unkempt, as if it might have fleas. It didn’t want to be held and twisted its head to bite me on the hand. So I put it down back outside the front door and went back in. The house had changed and was huge and had big doorways and archways. There was a lot of wood panelling in a light, warm coloured wood, and drapery in plain warm colours - yellows and oranges mainly. My partner and I went into one of the rooms to check my radiation levels with the geiger counter. It registered a high reading and I thought I should tell the doctor when I took it back in to give back. Then I noticed that the bag of pink liquid attached to it had punctured and some had come out on my hand. It had the consistency of liquid soap. I wondered if it was toxic and kept checking my hand but nothing bad seemed to happen. I went looking for something and found myself on a large landing. The doors from my bedroom on to it were tall wooden double doors and I couldn’t get them to close properly behind me. I realised that the landing was actually a public place with entrances to restaurants and so on, and people were coming and going, so it was all the more important to get my doors to shut although I soon forgot about them as it felt like I was in Italy and I was pleased about that.",341,4,2,0,2,2,1-sep.-20,1,52,1,0,0,5,5,3,4,4,4,4,3,5,1,24,52,47,19,100,2.4,2.57,1,2,1.76,28.04,1.17,0.59,0.59,0.29,0.29,0,0,0,0.98,0.98,18.48,7.33,0.1,0.1,17.01,9.38,7.62,0.54,0.54,DD_Report_pruned,1,8.21,0.29,0,0,0.59,15.25,12.02,0.29,0.88

While I was there, I noticed one class, form 3, was without a teacher. They seemed to be short staffed. It turned out that their regular teacher was on a course on Thursdays. I offered to another teacher that I could keep an eye on them if she liked. I said I was there to keep an eye on my own son anyway, and so I could just bring in some work to do on Thursdays and do it there, so the class had someone to turn to if needed. She accepted and said they would pay me, but then asked if I was OK to be paid in Sainsbury’s coupons. I laughed and said no, because I don’t shop there, and she said that was OK. I said it would come in handy to top up the scholarship my son was applying for but then I said I shouldn’t count on that as he hadn’t won it yet.

I had a huge wooden musical instrument case with me, and they wanted to look inside and try the instruments, which was OK. One girl, who I recognise from real life, was really musical and played everything one by one. One instrument was a gigantic type of saxophone and I told her that even though it was made of brass, it was a woodwind instrument, and I saw a parent, a black man, nodding approvingly out of the corner of my eye. He asked me when I began to sing, which I didn’t really and there had been no mention of, and I said I had a lot of different hats, and that I had worked in technical theatre when I first left school.

The concert was being held up north in the castle area. We had to get there by bus, and I quizzed my friend very carefully about the bus times coming and going. When we arrived, we went into this room in the castle estate that was wholly unsuitable for a concert: it had a large wooden barrier across the middle that blocked the view from either side (kind of like a Japanese public bath); the conductor sat on top of it, and chairs were aligned to face it on both sides. There were already some orchestra members sitting in the chairs with their instruments but otherwise they were dressed in everyday clothes. So I sat next to one of them but was quickly moved to the back row, where other musicians were also sitting. This row had a lounge chair where I could sit with my feet out.

But in fact there were students everywhere studying, and also students camped out on the floor so that you could hardly walk by. No tents, but all the students had tarps laid out with all their craftgoods on them; some were flint knappers and their stone tools were laid out as if for sale. We finally made it to a back bedroom where another Chinese colleague from Chicago joined us. It was getting very late, like 2am, and I was very tired. My friend ran a bath and put her foot into it because she had a sore foot. I desperately wanted to get in, and hinted that I would like to stay overnight. But she didn't respond, and my colleague left. So I followed him out and learned a new way into the library down a narrow passage into a train station. There was a train waiting, only two cars long, more like a tram, but I didn't know where it was going, in a city I'd never been before. But I got on anyway to see where it would take me. I was conflicted whether to send my sister a text explaining that I was out overnight but didn't want to wake her. By this time it was 3am, and I was hungry. So I got out a cutting board and green onions from my shopping bag and proceeded to start making a salad, cutting up the green onions into 1 cm lengths. But then I realized I didn't have a bowl with me, so I got out a pack of radishes and just ate them onion pieces and radishes by hand. This was all on the tram with people around me as I stood in the center aisle. When the tram finally stopped I got out, and the sun was shining brightly, resting on the horizon. The all-night sun.

The uni friends were people I met through clubs and societies, not coursemates. I remember feeling that they looked familiar but I couldn't remember all their names.  I was in some sort of backstage role. I was watching a rehearsal from the audience position. There was a lot of chaos and noise. One of the costumes was a giant bird with enormous wings and real feathers. The wings were as wide as the dancer was tall. The feathers were dark brown like stained wood with lighter brown mottled patches. The female dancers walked everywhere on pointe, which confused me.  One person didn't like their role and wanted a different role but was told no by the director. I didn't recognise the director. The spurned cast member lay her head down on a train track that appeared across the stage area running from the rear of the stage to the front of the stage near the audience seats. There was a tunnel in the wall and a train was coming.  The cast member who lay on the tracks was short and had brown hair which was cut in a bob and pinned back on one side with hair pins. She wore a brown skirt suit with beige piping and I thought she looked old-fashioned. It was her character's costume.  The train came and ran through the theatre and then vanished. The person got up and was fine and walked down the tunnel.  I followed. We ended up inside an attic space looking through a peephole in the door at a ballet rehearsal. The performance was related to the Disney movie Frozen. There was a character in white who represented Elsa. She danced on pointe. There were two men in brown suits as costumes. They were the male characters from the film. There were about 20 ensemble cast members dressed as villagers in brown and purple and green colours.

It was Christmas time and there was a big long dining table that would have accommodated all of us. The location was not a familiar one to me but I accepted that it was a house belonging to somebody in the family. It had a feeling of a castle with stone walls and tapestries hung on the walls. It was gloomy because the only light was from the fire and candles on the walls. We had to make buttonhole arrangements before we could go out. I was told this was a family tradition. I asked why we were doing this when we haven't done it before. The family insisted we've always done this. There was a shout that we needed more holly. There was actually no holly on the table and there hadn't been any the whole time. My mother in law was fussing about how could we forget the holly. Some holly was brought in from the garden. My wife's youngest cousin brought me a finished buttonhole and said I had to be the first to wear it. I didn't want to and I packed my bags to leave. The cousin had a strange look in his eye that I didn't trust. Then, I was at an underground train station. My extended family were there with me: my mum, my aunt and my cousins. I was aware that my Nan was also there but I didn't see her. Everyone had a ridiculous amount of luggage with them. I was exasperated that my family had packed so much. Everyone had at least two large suitcases and another bag with them. We were running late for a train. We had to try and get all of us and our bags to the platform. The entry barriers reminded me of the ones in the London underground. They were narrow and it was a struggle to get everyone's bags through. Some porters appeared with trolleys for the bags. We were all running down a tunnel corridor to get to the platform. I kept trying to get my mum to give me some of her cases to lighten her load but she wouldn't let me. When we got to the platform, the train was there. It was very plush and it had two levels like European trains. There were lots of people trying to get on. The seats looked like they were covered with blue velvet. The outside of the train was brown. It reminded me of a fancy old-style steam train I saw at Carlisle station once. It only looked like a steam train - I was aware it wasn't really a steam train. It didn't look like there would be room for us all to get on with all the bags. I turned away and put my hand in my jacket pocket. I felt a phone there that wasn't mine. It was really bulky and could fold in half like a flip-phone but it didn't look like anything I've seen in real life. It had rubberised corners that made it feel unpleasant for me to touch. I knew it wasn't my phone. I opened the flip-phone and tried to work out who it belonged to. A girl I knew from school walked by asking if anyone had seen her phone. I yelled out ""Laura! Laura!"", Trying to get her attention. It was too noisy in the station with all the people around. I kept yelling and the girl turned around. When I saw her face, I remembered that her name was Lindsay not Laura. I gave her the phone with my arm outstretched over everyone's heads. I told her that it had ended up in my pocket but I didn't know how. She handed me another phone in exchange and said it had ended up in her pocket. It wasn't my phone I opened Facebook on the new phone to see if there were pictures of the owner. It belonged to Alex. I yelled Alex's name and she was in the crowd. We tried to exchange phones because she had my phone but someone in the crowd slipped their phone into Alex's hand so I now had my phone and her phone, and she had a phone that wasn't hers. I looked at the person who pulled the switch with the phones and it was an old woman who looked homeless. She tried to take Alex's phone from me.i yelled out to Alex that she had the wrong phone. The person was scrabbling at my hand trying to take Alex's phone. I managed to get Alex's phone back to her at the same moment as the homeless woman triumphantly held up a SIM card and said she'd taken it from Alex's phone.",816,1,4,0,2,2,1-sep.-20,1,31,2,1,1,5,4,4,5,5,4,5,2,3,1,24,70,26,28,107,1.8,1.86,13,10,1.35,16.07,0.49,0.86,0.37,0,0.37,0,0.12,0.12,0.97,0.97,19.85,9.93,0.42,0.42,20.34,14.09,6.25,0.69,0.7,DD_Report_pruned,1,7.97,2.08,0,3.06,0.61,14.09,14.71,0.49,0

The location was not familiar to me.  There was an enormous pyramid in the centre of the space. The pyramid appeared to be made of firm foam covered in vinyl. The vinyl was red on the sides of the pyramid and blue on the cap. The pyramid had four sides and the top was cut off to create a platform. It reminded me of children's soft play equipment.   To reach the top of the pyramid, it was necessary to climb many flights of stairs. There were two staircases - one on each side of the pyramid. I chose one staircase and my wife and her parents chose the other.   I felt annoyed that they had chosen not to come with me and worried that they were annoyed with me for not coming with them.   After climbing the many flights of stairs slowly because my lungs had a problem and I couldn't breathe well enough to go any faster, I got to the top and found myself looking down at the top of the pyramid. I was about 2 flights of stairs (one storey) higher than the top of the pyramid and I then had to descend in order to get to the top. My wife and her parents arrived at the top of the pyramid at the same time as I did but their staircase finished level with the pyramid top.  The reason I had chosen the staircase I did was because it went directly up whereas the one they chose went down first. They told me so at the top.  The top of the pyramid was very large. The floor was made of a foam-padded vinyl (blue) grid with white netting in between. We had to crawl on our bellies to safely move across it.

Very scruffy and not performing well at the assessed tasks. I recognised some of the cadets as people I had attended cadets with when I was a teenager. They seemed to be the same age as me. I did not have the feeling of being younger again.  The camp was a competition between lots of different detachments. I was annoyed with my detachment that they were performing so badly. I had returned to help them with this camp - I wasn't a regular member of the group. We wore camo pattern trousers and green woollen jumpers. Everyone had a shoulder patch called a brassard that displayed the badges of rank and achievements they had earned. None of my detachment had any badges.  Initially, we were all in tents in a field. Then, we were called to assemble at a main drill square which was surrounded by portakabin classroom spaces. The drill square was made of a concrete style material, like old pavements. It was dark grey and had a rough surface.  There was another detachment there who were all excellent. They were neatly turned out and had pristine uniforms and lots of badges.  One of the cadets from the other detachment saw me and recognised me. She was tall and naturally bright blonde. Her hair was in a bun. I recognised her. She greeted me like an old friend and I explained I'd come back to the detachment. She said she left that detachment to join the one she was currently in because they were so much better. She asked me what star level I had. I said I hadn't progressed from 1 star when I had been with the detachment previously. She was a 4 star and proudly showed me her badge. I congratulated her but privately felt jealous.  I went back to my detachment and they asked me why I was talking to the girl. I said I had trained her at my detachment before she left. I told them that I taught her how to march and now she was a 4 star.  We were told that there would be an inspection of our detachment meeting place as part of the competition camp. We rushed to get back there and tidy it. The space was in a shared building. On the way in, we passed my old Brownie leader and my old Sunday School teacher coming out. I greeted the Brownie leader with ""hi"" and the Sunday School teacher with ""hello, Mrs Addison"". The boys in the detachment mocked me for this.  Our old cadet leader was at the meeting space. I found him very creepy. He had missing teeth and I couldn't stop looking at them. His teeth were brownish yellow from smoking  The meeting space was a mess. I started telling people what to do. I told some boys to take the rubbish bins out and some to sweep the room. We had to go and collect some mugs from a shared kitchen. There were two older women in there. I think they were connected to the Sunday school. They tutted about us and complained among themselves about our untidiness and general unpleasantness.  The cadet leader told me that as I am a girl, I must be able to sew. He asked me to sew a cover out of white bin bags for a toilet door to prevent the inspector from seeing that the door had been damaged at the top. The door was made of chipboard covered in pale grey plastic and a large chunk of it had been ripped off to reveal the jagged chipboard inner.   I rummaged in a Danish biscuits sewing tin (a round metal tin that used to contain biscuits and now contains sewing supplies) for some white thread but could only find black. The boys mocked me.

The wheels were stood on edge as if ready for use. They were solid stone with a square hole cut from the middle as though for an axle.  I pushed one of the wheels to see what would happen.

I was in a cinema, watching a film with others. It felt like part of an event, or a festival. The difference was that the audience provided the musical soundtrack to the dialogue of the film. So as we sat there we would sing ro whistle tunes that we thought went with the action. Groups of people in the cinema would come up with different themes.

I was very pleased with myself that I could pick her up with such ease. I laid her on the bed, ready to perform cunnilingus on her.  I was in a cinema, watching an animated abstract film, full of vivid blue shapes morphing and changing. There was quite a few people in the cinema, one man with a lot of curly hair and a tall hat, which was getting in the way.  I was in a building with large offices, laying cable around the edges of the ceilings. I did this in a few rooms.  I was attending class at somewhere like Goldsmith's University. A band had played, there was a table in the room with a few of us standing around, confused and irritated that there was no teacher. I leafed through the papers on the desk, they were meticulous transcriptions of the guitar parts the band had played, which intrigued me as it is very unusual to have such detailed music scores for a rock band. There was somebody else there, a man, who gave the impression that we were close buddies on the course, and he started to wipe the bare white walls with his hand - there seemed to be some apprehension that we hadn't performed a task of setting up the room with our work. As he wiped his hand over the wall, it produced some kind of virtual art - bright blue 3D plastic shapes, small structures entwined in chains, which he spread over the wall. These then became part of the paintings, framed, which he covered the walls with quickly. We were impressed at his speed. This room sloped down to the far end, where the next class had now gathered. They, with their teacher, started to walk round the room looking at the paintings. There was now a walkway around the room, with glass partitions enclosing them as they walked around. I joined them, it was very crowded.  I was in the street with someone, in the city. I pushed a nondescript door, flush with the wall, so that you may not have noticed it, and entered, encouraging him to come with me. I was a member and this was a side door we could use. We went into a room, full of stuff on the floor. There were people setting up an exhibition. They said it wasn't open yet, but we could go into the next room and have a look. We entered the next room, where there were art installations. These were like long tree branches, artifical, with bright multi-coloured leaves and flowers attached to them. My companion found at the end of a branch a pair of spectacles and deduced that the idea was to put them on and did so. He urged me to do the same. I grasped a branch, trying to work my way along its length, through the thick foliage with some difficulty. I could see the spectacles at the end but they were tantalisingly out of reach.  An old friend of mine, Allan, who i haven't seen for years, came down to stay, as he used to. We were walking down Baker St and passed what looked like a shopfront, but was the entrance to a club, It was covered in light bulbs. I remarked to him that I remembered going to this club with him. He didn't see it, so we circled around to find it again. We couldn't see it at all. I tried to remember what it was called, but could only think of one called Shoom, which I knew it wasn't. As we turned round the next corner, going now in the opposite direction, the street ahead of us opened up into a large canyon, buildings and normal shops in the near foreground, blending into a mountainous landscape in the distance. We walked down the street, we thought is was some kind of art installation. The 'mountain' was clearly an artificial construction, purple with green shades and some red. We were delighted at this novel site, and proceeded down a walkway into the mountain where there were trees and clearings we gazed down upon. We were delighted.",718,3,3,0,3,#NULL!,1-sep.-20,1,65,0,1,1,3,2,2,3,3,2,3,3,4,2,5,3,18,19,58,1.2,2,10,4,2.09,33.88,1.53,0.56,0.84,0.42,0.42,0.14,0.14,0,0.93,0.93,16.02,7.94,0.64,0.64,15.88,10.86,5.01,0.79,0.79,DD_Report_pruned,1,3.76,2.65,0.14,2.65,1.39,16.99,10.58,0.84,0.97

For some reason I was compelled to be with them, though I felt very uncomfortable with them. We were walking down the street. Then I was in a car, driving, with them. The most sinister of them, in the  brown hat, was in the passenger seat. I kept asking him where we were going, he refused to answer, but pounded the dashboard with his fist. It was raining and the wipers were on. I kept going. We were in a city that I didn't know. It was full of foreboding. Then I was in a German city, driving on my own. I didn't know any directions, but I had to go to Dusseldorf. This was something to do with Ross, a friend of mine, although he wasn't there. Although I didn't know the way, I came to a central large junction, just followed the majority of cars, went round a corner off the junction, narrowly missing a protruding iron rail. I then saw signs to Dusseldorf, so was on the right road. Beside the road in this city centre flowed a huge, very wide river, which was sparkling and full of small, choppy waves. I felt exhilarated, suddenly it was going right. Later, I was on the river, in some kind of boat, looking at the city from the water.  I was then in the car, with my mother, driving on a road on the outskirts of Inverness. I was overtaking a car which kept going faster, so I had to increase speed to overtake. But then a roundabout came up, I braked but was going too fast to stop, or the brakes weren't very good. As I entered the roundabout, I caused a car coming round to brake, skid and turn round 180 degrees, causing it to crash. We were unhurt and not involved in the crash. I pulled away from the roundabout, wondering if I should stop, but carried on, thinking I have got away with it.",353,1,3,0,2,1,1-sep.-20,1,65,0,1,1,3,2,2,3,3,2,3,3,4,2,5,3,18,19,58,1.2,2,10,4,1.7,14.08,0.57,1.13,0.85,0.57,0.28,0,0,0,1,1,18.98,9.07,0.29,0.29,14.73,11.61,3.12,0.65,0.65,DD_Report_pruned,1,8.22,1.13,0,1.13,1.13,16.43,13.03,0,1.42

However Raymond decided to get them so I was mildly irritated that he had taken 'my' present, so I was looking around for what else there was. There only seemed to be books, like art books, which were unsuitable for young boys. The shop was busy.  We were then in a car, Raymond was driving. He was telling me a story about something that had happened to him. It was something serious, a close escape or similar. I just knew it was a serious incident. We parked in Queensgate, Inverness, my home town, after searching for a parking space. I could see other cars clearly jockeying for space. They all seemed to large vintage cars.

There was a long wedding reception scene in which people ate two meals (regretting the fact that I had not ordered the fish for the second meal, because the fish in the first one was disappointing, but then it turned out the second meal had been cooked by a different restaurant). Then everyone started getting drunk; in particular, my partner got so drunk she couldn't walk and completely forgot I had a freedom-or-servitude game coming up. I was heartbroken but sent her away. In the end, we played the card game; I lost two rounds so I was eliminated, but at the last minute Loki won over my aunt and released me. My friends drove me away.

The small field party has truly become a festival with surrounding fields filled with tents. We have to drive to the toilets because they are so far away. By the time we have gone to the toilet there are huge queues to use them.   We head back to the tent which has now become a stately building. Again we discuss the previous night in the drawing room of this big house. They ask me about my night. I cant recall much detail as I was drunk, though my friend says I appeared sober during the night. At this point I look out of the window as I see a flash of light that turns out to be a fireball, erupting like a mushroom cloud. The view from the window overlooks the fields and beyond, a bay with the Disney castle on an island in the sea. It is being attacked by dragons, torn apart and set ablaze. I tell my friends we need to get out of the building because, as it turns out, it is the White House and the dragons are clearly attacking important buildings. As I say this a fireball hurtles towards the building so I leap out of the window.  The fireball enters the building and engulfs everything inside including my friends, who are incinerated. Horrified and in a panic I rush to a bunker I know exists under the White House and enter it. I worry that I may be locked in and look for others who may have survived the blast. There is no one who can help. I enter the bunker alone to take a look around. It’s deserted. There’s windows looking out at the castle, the dragons have gone but it’s destroyed. I head further into the bunker and find a woman strapped to a table. At first she seems to be out cold but as I approach she opens her eyes and gives me a look of fear.",497,2,4,0,1,3,2-sep.-20,1,26,0,1,1,5,4,4,3,3,4,3,2,3,1,31,81,43,32,112,2.6,2.57,4,11,4.23,22.75,2.21,2.01,1.61,0.4,1.21,0.8,0,0.2,0.28,0.28,16.5,7.44,0.42,0.42,15.09,11.27,3.82,0.35,0.35,DD_Report_pruned,1,6.04,2.01,0,1.01,1.41,17.71,1.41,6.84,1.21
449,1020,0,,,9/12/20 11:25,12.09.2020,645,"I am overlooking a section of garden of the White House in which Donald Trump is talking to a camera crew. I catch snippets of what he’s saying but can’t quite work out if he’s doing an interview or acting out a scene with the person he’s talking to. From what I can hear of what he’s saying, it seems he’s amping his rhetoric up to new levels of outrageousness to outright parody. He seems self-aware. I try to film it myself but they’re too far away to get any good footage. Trump leaves the crew to go back into the White House. It turns out he will be doing an interview inside now, the interviewer being my friend, Jake. A while later there is commotion and Jake is wheeled out on a stretcher. It seems his line of questioning provoked Trump into attacking him. Jake is not majorly injured; he was just punched in the face and seems quite amused by it. Trump himself has fled as other media people descend on the scene. I rush to Jake to congratulate him on finally tipping Trump over the edge to do something he cannot come back from.  I am watching the events that follow as if in a cinema. A manhunt ensues in order to find the President and bring him to justice. Trump is being moved around by a loyal team of agents in a convoy of big black SUVs – his vehicle stops and remains in hiding under a bridge. Another vehicle goes ahead down a hill and as it reaches the bottom a chain is brought taught across the road at windscreen height. The chain rips through the car, taking its top off and horribly injuring the driver who is thrown from the vehicle. The passenger managed to duck the chain but is dazed from the subsequent crash. The driver is on the ground having lost most of his limbs somehow. He pleads for help and is executed by a shadowy figure with a gun. The dazed passenger tries to get himself together, but the shadowy figure appears behind him and stuns him further. The shadowy figure turns out to be James Bond, but as he was when acted by Pierce Brosnan. Bond then proceeds to cut open the passengers back and climb inside his body as a form of disguise. It’s really fucking horrible.Trump is inside his vehicle, nervous about the disappearance of the car that went ahead. His driver reassures him as he sees the driver of the missing vehicle approach them. It’s Bond in his disguise and once he gets close the driver begins to become unsure, but it’s too late and Bond executes him – shooting him in the head which explodes. Trump is rattled as Bond gets in the car with him. Bond proceeds to talk to Trump and threaten him. It seems he needs to bring him in but is also weighing up whether to execute him too.  At this point the lights go up in the cinema and even though people begin to leave their seats I am certain the film hasn’t ended, it’s just an intermission so I don’t leave my seat. However, it seems everyone is leaving, even using emergency exits. I am disappointed and even though it may be an emergency, I remain seated.",556,2,4,0,1,1,2-sep.-20,1,26,0,1,1,5,4,4,3,3,4,3,2,3,1,31,81,43,32,112,2.6,2.57,4,11,4.14,11.15,1.44,2.34,1.08,0.54,0.36,0.18,0,0.18,0.25,0.25,18.35,8.27,0.75,0.75,14.03,9.53,4.5,0.5,0.5,DD_Report_pruned,1,2.34,0,0,6.47,0.54,17.09,2.34,9.17,0.72

I am taking her on a journey I have not made before but feel as though I have; locations and routes are familiar despite not actually having seen them before in real life. Feels a bit like déjà vu. I know my way and lead Em around confidently. On the bullet train I excitedly explain to her how fast bullet trains travel and how smoothly they do despite this. I point out the speed we are travelling at on a readout. The train lurches around corners instead of smoothly like it is meant to which is slightly disconcerting. The train also has a lot of British tourists on board too. We have to disembark the train in a rural location to make a connection, I lead Em along the allegedly familiar route of the train station. I notice that the platform that we need to get our connecting train is seems to have been partly demolished with huge earthworks built up around and on top of it. In a state of panic I am separated from Em but she catches up. The station surrounding the platform seems to be partly converted into an art gallery and I note a deconstructed crochet bumblebee which I point out to Em. The art is accompanied by an explanation being pretentious and unnecessarily glum. Again the whole place seems familiar yet it has changed from what I remember, so I am confused and try to find aspects that haven’t changed. On a bridge overlooking the tracks I notice the rails have been removed and workers digging up the sleepers. The British tourists from the bullet train are still milling about and we begin to walk through the rural area to reach Shanghai.   I am playing a video game, enacting or living the game rather than playing it in the normal sense. The game involves stealing the eggs of flying creatures and takes place on rock spires and cliffs high above the sea. I am flying around, sometimes sailing, dodging the attacks of the flying creatures. It’s exciting but also frustrating.  I am working with a colleague, Sophie, who has been furloughed since the lockdown started in the UK and still is. She has returned to work and has too much work to catch up with and is flustered and exasperated; she is reprimanded for not being able to properly take care of things by a superior. I have tried to help but ended up breaking a piece of artwork she looking after because I have stored it somewhere inappropriate in her time away. I stored it on my grandma’s balcony with other art pieces. The weather is terrible with the wind and rain being the cause of the breakage. I am at my grandma’s but I am video calling her despite her seemingly being in the house, however she is having problems with technology and our conversation is lost. My focus being on this is the reason I have neglected the artwork and why it has broken. I feel upset at losing the connection with my grandma and guilty about my colleague who is clearly annoyed at me and may lose her job.   I am watching online footage of a footballer walking along a street who reprimands his teammate for using a homophobic slur against him. He insists that acceptance of peoples’ sexuality is part of being Catalan. To back this statement up he points out the stripes on his jersey, yellow and red as proof of this. This colour association doesn’t make sense to me. The other player disagrees and a scuffle ensues. All this time as they are walking down the street other bizarre interactions start happening like passers by groping the players, cars causing accidents and then the players are robbed. A person with me who seems like a detective pauses and rewinds the clip and tries to encourage me to work out the situation and who has committed what crimes.

One particular person is making my life difficult and then it turns out my line manager is leaving and being replaced by this other individual.

There was a fireplace and a four-poster bed. The only misleading thing was the “very colourful” – through a doorway there was a brilliant yolkyellow room butand all the others and the minimal furniture were splashed with splashes of washy pink and purple as if someone had thrown a Paint pot at it. There was a particularly disappointing large ugly statue of a deer made of wood or wickerwork in the sitting room with a splash of lavender on its nose.

At some point, there was a competition to make pots. And it turned out that the Chilean man was really really good at making pots. He made large pots on the wheel, and they sort of turned into flowers. That is a really good way of making money as well. I said to him, “Gosh, you could earn your living doing this.” I think he already knew that. So it was a dream about me yearning for this man who was together with my best friend.

THe place is ot like the real Getty but it is a place with different levels and there are escalators to go to te different evels.

I then take one of the escalator and go to the exhibition, I amwith a group of people, not sure they are frinds, they are most art historians, they might be fellows at the Getty Reserahc Institute. I do not remember how the exibition was but I remember that after it I offered to take some of the people that where with me back to wherever we were going by car. THey were not the very same people that had come with me so I was wondering if it was the good thng to do but I did not want to wait the others and it had become dark meanwhile. So I asked the people that were with me if some of them wanted to come by car instead of taking the train, THey were deciding as they were 5 and I could only take 4 of them with me. THey did not know how to choose who was goign to come with me and at a certain point the word monarchist came out and I said that I id not want any monarchist in my car, half joking and half serious, and I realised that I have slightly offended the old man. I told my husband to tell the other people who hd come with me by car that I had left and I also tried to tell him the name of the only people that I knew that was coming with me know, but I could not remember it on the spot, so I told him instead the main article that she had wrtten and only after a while I was able to tell hm the full name. THen we went to the parking lot to take the car but I could ot find it. I tried to use the remote control of the key but I could not see it. And then I realised that part of the parking had been invaded by water so some cars were partially under water, olny up to half wheel, but still it was difficult to get in it. IT became progresivily difficult to not only find the car but move for one level of the parking to the other, people were giving me advice on how to find it. Someone who worked at the Getty told me that this happened often and there were people tat put a sort of localiser in their car to be able to retrieve it. Then I went out of the building of the parking lot and I had to go back but the stars or escalators where now full of people coming in the opposite direction and I could not go against them. I think that at the end I might have not been able to find the cr as the last thing I remember of this dream is travelling in perhaps a train with the people who should have come in my car. One of them was a person tha I know, she is an art historian. Her friend, who had long brown hair with two plaits in the front, one on each side of her face, was very taalkative and I asked her if she would be able to give me lessons, I think of Spanish, and she told me that she was working at the Getty, she had been working there the whole summer, and she would go on holiday after SEptember.

There weren’t enough cakes so I went to buy another cake, a small one and I chose a chocolate éclair with cream in choux pastry.

A few of us did And I went into this large concrete toilet, there were mostly cubicles without doors but I found one with a door, you had to go up steps to sit down on the toilet and It was dirty so I didn’t sit down. I did a poo by the side of the toilet. I was really tired and I wanted to just lie down after having done the poo. But I knew it would be revolting to lie down. I cleaned up the poo and came out. I'd noticed that P was there and we started chatting and somehow we ended up having a reconciliation. I said to her “When are you coming to Bristol? When are you coming to see me? I would so love it if you came and stayed with me. I really miss you.” and we had a big hug. So that was nice. And then we were back into this art gallery or museum, where there had been something going on to do with climate change and animal extinction. They'd done this thing where you listen to a recording as you go around the museum, so that you think about the animals. And I was trying to record the recording. But it turned out that it wasn't the whole recording, it was just a preview trailer. It was going to be released that evening at eight o'clock, so I only had a tiny bit of it. We were walking through the gallery and the person who was leading the group had long white stringy hair which she had dyed a pale yellow but you could see all her roots. I was with a group of people. And we were all very tired and we were lying down and telling stories to each other. I was lying next to a much younger man, a friend. I just remember, really enjoying lying next to him, I could feel the warmth of his body snuggled up against mine. He seemed to be really enjoying lying next to me too. We had to tell a story of an object that was important to us, that had been handed down through the family, something we would like to keep. And everybody was telling their story and it turned out that loads of them were aristocratic types. They were telling historical stories about valuable heirlooms, and I was trying to think of something. And then they said “oh now it's C's turn” but instead of saying C's turn they said “it's Rachel's turn.” And just as I started to speak P, who was lying on the other side of the man started to speak over me, she'd been to the toilet again I think and she just come back when they said, “It's Rachel turn” she started telling her story. So I didn't tell my story and then at the end of that everybody acted as if it was now time to have sandwiches. And I went, “Oh, but I haven't said my story,” and some people noticed and listened but other people started telling more stories. And it was frustrating trying to tell my story. I was feeling really frustrated. That was quite tricky. And I'm not quite sure which story I was going to say. I wanted to say something about my Nana being a seamstress and having been in service and my grandfather being an orphan. And some thing about both my parents being thieves, but they weren't really thieves. It's just that there are a few funny stories about them stealing things. Or that's how the family knew them but I'm trying to think now what on earth it could have been or whether it was just something I made up in the dream. For instance, my mother stole a plant when she was with me at the garden centre. We could choose one free plant to take with us, if we spent more than £20, so my mum made sure that we spent £20, then we went to choose the plant on the way out. And I couldn’t decide which plant to choose so she suddenly said, “Just take both” and then “Run!” So we did. That was the kind of thing that my mum used to do. There's various little stories like that in my family. And of course, the whole thing about what we did with my Dad's ashes which was completely illegal. We scattered my dad's ashes in Australia around a tree with the sound of the sea and you're not supposed to do that. So we did it very surreptitiously.

No furniture or people, Just one or two belongings placed on the floor to reserve space.   I got really upset. I’d spent a while considering where I wanted to sit and one person objected to where I sat down. She picked a fight with me, she kept physically jumping on me. She had left her things nearby and she came back and grabbed me round the neck. I was saying: “Please take your hands off me. This is physical abuse.

M was arranging the chocolate in it and he was eating it. And a child went past and she was feeding him with a spoon and digging down to the bottom of the bowl to get at the small droplets of chocolate and feeding him.

Against this purple and pink I show him the smoke raising from several bonfires, creating a strange zig-zag pattern, and then I also notice and show him tro groups of people, they are agitated, they are buring of destroying things, and I tell Tito that they are revolting. Although the scenary is very dramatic, I seem not woried at all.  Then we keep going looking for a place where Tito can sleep, but it is clear that we are not in the right place as we are in a sort of urban environment and Marco makes a joke saying: ""it is very strange that there is no place where you can leave your child to sleep in San Francisco"". Tito is very at ease with Marco, he likes him, and I find myself thinking that Marco would be a marvellous dad.

There seemed to be abandoned shoes everywhere, but none were mine. I was a bit annoyed, with myself for losing them, with the person that took them. It was crowded, and I hate crowds, so I was grumpy.  I went to drop off a bag of clothes to a friend of my daughter, she had left them at our house. I’d travelled by bus. This friend was not the owner of the clothes, but I thought she would know to whom they belonged. She lived with an older brother and sister, her parent were deceased. Her brother was talking with friend’s at the front gate and welcomed me in. The front lawn was so steep, I had to crawl and climb clinging to trees and shrubs. I kept slipping back wards. While I was crawling up the lawn, the police came in to raid them for drugs. I finally got in, and my daughters friend let me know to whom the clothes belonged.

Sarah is in a wedding dress, it is the dress she got married in last year but it looks like a different dress, she is pregnant. She is wearing a flower garland. I am still confused because I know they had a baby in real life in mid August. I think, they must be getting married again for their family because they're pregnant and want to get married before the baby arrives. But then there is a toddler girl there who is their daughter. They get into their car and I say congratulations. Then I'm watching Phantom of The Opera being performed in a theatre, but it's not Phantom of The Opera as I know it. They are performing parts of it but not as a whole. It is dramatic with elaborate props, make up and costumes. Then I'm in Stawell. I'm in a meeting with local council, community leaders and business. They're talking about hosting the One Night Stand concert, if the government supports it, otherwise they're ready to proceed. The building turns into a beautiful old Victorian, provincial style homestead. There are beige/grey rendered walls and black ornate features. It is a bed and breakfast accomodation. I'm with the owner who is a middle aged woman with blond hair. She talks about buying the building/business off her dad over a card game and turning it into an accommodation / continuing the business. I feel an urgency to book this accommodation so I can attend the One Night Stand concert. The council members are performing Phantom Of The Opera in the accommodation. The woman is in theatre make up with black feathers on her head and black hair cut short in a bob, 1920s style. There is deep blue, black, stars, fireworks. I want to watch the whole thing.  Then I am still in Stawell and still in the Victorian building but it has turned into a wedding. I feel like it is my wedding day but not. Aimee is there with some other women and it is a Hen's party.  They have penis straws. AImee is holding a straw, laughing, saying she doesn't really like the penis straws. I chuckle and say, ""I don't mind them! If they're used in a decorative way or as a garden ornament"" I indicate to a white paper crepe penis hanging in the breeze like bunting. There is a lot of off-white bunting, streamers and decorations swaying in the warm breeze, it feels like Spring.  We are still in Stawell, it is late afternoon, there is warm, soft light, the grass is yellow/grey and dry, like it is in Summer, it feels whimsical. We are being guided to walk down the road for the start of the wedding. There are more white decorations and art works.

I was alive, looking on after the event, but I had died. I was wondering how it could've been prevented.  Steve and I were traveling home on a bus at the end of the day. It was a cloudy late afternoon/ early evening. We could see trees had fallen down everywhere, like in a storm.  We got out of the bus and tried to clean up the fallen trees. I felt sad and a sense of loss and wanted to save the environment. I was trying to teach the other people who were there, how to save the environment.  I'm getting in line to board a cruise ship/ bus for a work event. I'm waking through the aisles to check in and trying to sneak past my managers to sneak Steve on board. We all have luggage as though it's a holiday. In the mean time, as I'm walking down a path in the check in (but its like a street) I see Abe. I see him twice. The first time I want to say hi but don't because of the negative circumstances around how our relationship ended. When I see him the second time, I go up and say hi. He tells me he has 2 kids now, who are 4 and 8 years old. I think this doesn't make sense because we were in a relationship 3 years ago and he didn't have kids. He was holding a child and looked fatherly and then he changed to look more like a woman. I thought how much he had changed since I knew him. I felt angry and jealous that he had a family now but I didn't, especially when he made a big deal about not wanting kids yet when we were together.  I then come to being on a big boat in the ocean with Steve and my colleagues.  The boat staff take us out on smaller boats to our own small individual cruise boats where we'll spend the night. There is a beautiful sunset. The next day we come back to the main boat. Everyone was given two boxes of breakfast food, but I only got one and felt like I missed out. I opened the box and there was cereal. I ate the cereal and could taste it and feel the texture in my mouth. Then I had this massive bowl of pasta in front of me. I couldn't eat it all.  There was a huge buffet and so much food, I didn't know where to start. But we couldn't stay, I had to then get up and leave to get on the boat to go home. We're lining up to get on the boat but I feel really disoriented and lose the group. Steve gets on the boat before me. When I get to the boat, they don't let me on because the boat is full. A male colleague and I can't board the boat. I feel angry that they didn't consider us and no one counted that everyone in the group was there before boarding. I felt the managers should have done that but then I think ""well,  we're all adults, not school kids"". I'm angry that Steve wasn't meant to be there in the first place but he took my place on the boat home. I'm angry that they had capacity to bring us out here but not to take us all back. We try to book another boat back but the next one is on Wednesday which is 3 days away. We have to self fund our return ticket and it is expensive.I think ""I hope this is tax deductible!"". I go to get my credit card but I can only find old, expired credit cards in my wallet. I worry that Steve has taken all my things with him onto the boat and now I have no clothes or money. Then I find my credit card and I realise I have all that I need. I feel attracted to the male colleague with me. I feel hopeful that something romantic will happen between us. But I feel like he doesn't notice me. I feel like I need to stick with him so I'm not alone and don't accidentally miss the next boat. The colleague then turns into Adam. We walk through a gift shop at the boat terminal and I'm looking at note pads with funny faces on them and think if I should buy a souvinear for Steve. It turns out that we're on an island and we get into a taxi to take us to our rooms.

The place was a bit like Hobart, the 'Salamanca' waterside area...lots of old heritage buildings arranged around a waterfront.   I walked up a flagstoned lane between sandstone warehouses with weather beaten wooden hatches and rusted iron stays. I headed alone towards the crowds around the festival site. There were different themed events in each building. An old stone pub was decked out as a pirate haven. One of the waterfront buildings had a 'haunted arctic' theme to it. I wandered around the venues trying to connect with my friends...weaving between crowds and the weirdly themed buildings. Each one was like a film set. I was becoming increasingly frustrated as I couldn't locate my friends and my mobile phone had developed a surreal bug where it was aging...the OS was crumbling and becoming Windows 7. Out of frustration I tried to go to or find a 'reception' area to get some help to locate my friends. I just couldn't find anyone to help...everything was surreal and unfathomable. No one could point me in the right direction or really help me. I wandered into a hotel in a 50's style, got lost in the stairways and weird empty lobbies twisting around a central atrium. I had to get out of the maze and finally exited and went to the next confusing space. This was the pirate themed bar...again I was searching for friends with no luck. I got tangled in a set of elevated stairways and planked walkways tied together with rough shipping ropes above the bar area. Then finally found my way back to ground level...I reached for my phone in another attempt to communicate.

He started by throwing the first opportunity to me, to 'distinctly and clearly articulate the major arguments' of the Russian guy's book, and that I might also want to refer to one of our Department's academics work. I mumbled something about needing to re-read the old book, and not quite knowing the new book, or the new author, but was ready to make a summative comment about what I thought it was about - but before I could make this comment Tony talked over me and gave the opportunity to someone else, realising that he'd put me on the spot.

As in, the book was a bag of chips, and each chip had text on it, on both sides. The problem was that it was all in order when I got the bag, but as soon as I opened it, of course the chips started to move around and it was impossible to keep them in order! I started pulling them out one by one and trying to read them, but realised it was futile, that there was no way I'd be able to make sense of the thing as a whole. I was very confused and couldn't understand why anyone would write a book in this format. I decided that I'd get myself a proper copy of an actual book, but knew that that would have to wait, or I'd have to pay a lot or something. But in the process of looking at the chips I realised what the book was about and thought of my brother and was going to tell him about it. It seemed the book was kind of a backwards story, in that the author wrote of having a fantasy childhood, like a fairytale, not real, and then growing into - and travelling into - a real world.",450,2,4,0,2,1,2-sep.-20,0,48,1,1,0,3,4,3,3,5,3,4,2,4,1,34,76,29,33,106,2.2,2.14,11,8,2.22,32.56,1.56,0.67,0.44,0,0.44,0,0.22,0,1,1,19.11,8.22,0.26,0.26,16.89,8.89,8,0.63,0.63,DD_Report_pruned,1,6.44,0.89,0,0.67,0.67,17.78,8.89,0,2.67

I'd be outside and he'd come out at 7.20 each evening. He'd have small packets of cosmetics that he'd brought from inside, which now seemed like a big department store. He'd take the tag thing off so that it wouldn't set the alarm off, and then he'd give them to the girl he was going to cheat with. She was tall and blond and elegant. There was a third party involved, a guy, who we ran through the exercise with a few times and then the husband checked that he would be able to do it every night, or every Friday, at 7.20.

I understand that to mean that all of them - my parents and my brother who lives with them - had come for dinner, but because we weren't home, they had left again. I was furious. They'd come all the way from New Zealand but hadn't bothered to ring first or let me know. As I moved around the house I realised that my brother was there. He was a bit shy about it and didn't say anything. I called my sister and had a rant to her about how they do this kind of thing - Mum particularly - that don't make any sense. And I guess I was sad that I had missed them. Then I started talking to my brother about it and he said 'Dad's here', and I thought, oh yeah, I thought I saw him. He was sitting in a little side room, at a table, with a plate of biscuits and loaf as he often does. I realised that I'd walked past that table several times, and taken a bit of loaf off it, eaten it, but hadn't noticed Dad. So I made some conversation about how I'd be terrible if I lived with Mum, because I'd eat little treats like that all the time if they were sitting around on a plate. But I was still really upset with Mum and didn't know what was going to be for dinner, and moved back through to the kitchen where my brother was, and started talking to him about Mum, but at the same time realised that she was there. I guess she'd been there all along. I couldn't understand how I didn't see her because she was all aflutter like she always is in the kitchen. Big pans of crumbed chicken and lots of other dishes on the go. She had her apron on and was totally into what she was doing. I went back into the side room and my brother was there now. There was a plate on that table - a different table to the one Dad was at - with a very strange looking cracker on it. The kind of square cracker you would usually put cheese on, but it was about an inch thick, with another centimetre layer on top of a darker yummy looking stuff. I picked it up and took a bite and it was very delicious, but very strange, and I thought perhaps healthy as well as delicious because it was very crumbly and a bit grainy. I was worried then that it was my brothers, and it was probably really expensive, and so I said to him that it was really yummy. He said 'oh yeah, it's got what they call animal icing on the top'.

This also meant being a consultant of a rugby game, and my analysis showed that farming and business and rugby tactics were all intricately woven together. I wasn't sure if the audience were quite understanding my complicated explanation. I had a whiteboard and drew a diagram of a rugby formation that I thought made everything wonderfully clear. There were vertical lines on one row, and then once I got down to about the sixth row I felt that everthing made perfect sense and drew very vigorous horizontal line across the players, making a loud noise with the pen and drawing over and over the horizontal line, which got quite a bit of attention. I felt like surely they must be able to understand now, especially the rugby people. Another row of the drawing concerned a single tooth.

I was organising to stay the night with her. The place was a real mess and I was trying to get things in order. There was stuff everywhere and dirty dishes and it seemed she needed food but there was a lot of stuff. She was happy though, and helping me to get organised, and I was thinking, this is great, I'll be able to come and stay here for a while next year and it will be a cheap way to live and we would be fine. And then I realised that Dad wasn't there, that he must have died and that's probably why I felt comfortable about going to live with her. But then I thought about how gross it would be to have to be there all the time, and to have to shower in that bathroom before going to work. But all the while I kept organising and making a shopping list for food. Mum was happy to have me organise dinner that night. She had some little bottles of McDuffs beer around the place, which used to be a favourite of mine when I lived in Dunedin. Then she bought all these books out - old slim volumes about walks and tramping around Dunedin. She suggested we work our way through all of them, doing all the walks. I thought it a great idea. There were heaps of them though, some slim but some quite big books. Maybe fifty books all together. I knew we could buy it now in one little volume, but I didn't want to disappoint her as she felt so good about having kept all the books all this time and that now we would make good use of them. She was very happy throughout the dream, quite energised and moving around. She told me to get dogfood. I was worried I would get the wrong sort, and kept meaning to ask her what kind to get, but then getting distracted. Then for a long time the dream was just about what I was going to cook for dinner. I just couldn't get it straight in my head. I couldn't get a single idea of what to cook that I could run through my head.

We were wandering along the beach and came to quite a narrow part, where the tide was in and almost trapping us in to the hill beside it.

Immediately the water started to recede, with each wave it drew further back, like a tsunami, but we knew it wasn't a tsunami, it was the virus having a ripple effect. But from then on it occurred like a tsunami - we became aware of a massive wave that was building up as the tide drew further back. We could see the wave, and then it was against a massively high cliff, maybe a kilometre up in the air. A straight cliff face with the wave drawing further and further up it.

537,1246,0,,,9/5/20 1:47,05.09.2020,815,I was meant to be going camping with friends on some hill/mountain top. The sky was pink and purple sunset. My friend was meant to drive me there but she said she was elsewhere so somehow I made it and found another friend there. We were talking about something but turns out we couldn’t camp that night because we didn’t have enough camping gear. I then ended up in a shopping centre and ran into two girls I’m no longer friends with and we were catching up. It was a bit awkward but we were friendly. Then my mum showed up and was shocked to see me and the girls were being friendly again and she told them off for how horrible they were to me. Then those girls left and I was getting ready to meet another group of friends at a cafe by the beach. I took the wrong bus and got lost and ended up at some beach shack coffee shop and ordered a coffee but the guy said it was $6.30 for a small coffee. I was reluctant to pay. Then another girl I’m not friends with anymore showed up and said I didn’t have to order it at all if I wasn’t ok with the price. She then invited me to a birthday party of another girl we both went to high school with. They were having cake and asked me to record them for Instagram while everyone - a big group of maybe 10 sitting along a long table - sang happy birthday. Somehow then the party was over and it was the day time and we were all dressed in black and white and we were at this other cafe by the beach again that looked familiar to the one in my hometown. They were doing an Oscars parody but real famous people were there. We were all bunched up around small tables and I went to grab a glass of water but then Michael B Jordan was there and said I shouldn’t drink it and gave me a bottle of water. Then this weird Oscars ‘game’ began and the whole cafe filled up with sand and there were cameras recording us do these weird tasks/challenges. Then somehow I was in the ocean and then ended up on shore again and went to these gross blue and white tiled public bathrooms trying to get all the sand off. Then I returned to the cafe and these people told me I ‘passed the game’.,420,1,4,0,3,#NULL!,2-sep.-20,0,23,1,1,1,4,4,4,3,4,4,4,4,4,3,25,68,36,28,95,2.2,2.43,9,10,3.81,37.34,2.38,1.19,0.95,0.71,0,0,0,0,0.95,0.95,18.57,9.29,0.43,0.43,15.24,10.48,4.76,0.69,0.69,DD_Report_pruned,1,5.95,2.38,0,0.95,1.19,13.57,14.05,0.71,0.71

My heart was pounding & my hands/face sweating. There was something flying past the opening which I couldn't work out at first. It looked like a lift without doors but then it was more like a guillotine. It seemed to be both. A sideways lift I had to jump into to take me away from the maze plus a guillotine going up & down really quickly. The lift moved to the right & left also so you had to time the jump perfectly. I think some people in front of me tried it & only one got through. The others were cut down with blood & guts were everywhere. It was suddenly my turn. Not because I was ready to try but only because the group were pushing towards it & I somehow ended up at the front. The blood etc was gone as if to give false sense of it being ok. I tried to work out the timing of the lift being there without the blade & nearly had it. Every time the lift came in from the right the blade was a bit slower. I just needed a few more passes then I could confirm it.

I went to park in the last space but noticed a lincoln continental appeared to have been pushed further onto the grass down a light embankment. There were black paint scratches on the side so I presumed it had been moved with a car. I didn't want to park our car there as it was black too & they might think I'd done it. Plus it would block the other car in. I drove a little further and saw another spot where rocks had been moved for parking but this place had a 'No Parking - fines will be issued' sign. I park amongst the rocks as I did a mental calculation of the odds of being fined & how much. I got out & ran towards the mausoleum. When we returned to the car a couple of council parking officers were sitting in a quad bike with a yellow flashing light on the roof blocking our car. The passenger got out & spoke to my father. I could hear only snippets of the conversation but it sounded like he was giving us a warning this time but no fine. My father wouldn't let it go as if he was insulted. He seemed to rant at the guy for quite awhile until the driver of the quad bike said ""come on, this jobs not worth it"" & started to drive off.

I knock on their door and I go inside. There are two women. One is wearing a yellow and black designed shirt while cooking. They show me a table with some clothes - there's a collection of shorts. One I pick up is a denim pair of shorts with a really small waist. They want me to try on some of the shorts. There are also towels there. I'm in parents kitchen. Someone, I think my dad, has left leftover food out and not fridged it so I'm annoyed. I chuck some rice in the bin and fridge everything else. For some reason Kylie and her family are in my parents backyard which they've accessed through a trail at the back. They leave.  I'm suddenly then watching a scene from a movie  A man throws leftover chicken and corn soup over a car and an argument starts with the man inside the car. It's a ploy to distract the man from going inside one of the shops. Then the director, a white guy, pauses the scene. An alternate scene runs which is slightly different, still involves the soup throwing. I offer some notes to the director.  We watch an elaborate film for staff that Bazmark made specifically for their employees when going through a shooting hiatus. Someone asks me to guess the film and I guess correctly that it's The Great Gatsby. I see casual photos of myself from various film/TV shoots. I point out one has my boss Jason's foot.

A girl was living in a flat and I knew somehow that she had been unhappy there. She was moving out. I was going to stay there for the duration of the conference/training. When I got in there I immediately thought, no wonder she was unhappy here, it was one small room, with a kitchenette. I had hundreds of wine glasses with me, that I was in charge of bringing to some evening event. I started getting them all out and filling them with wine, until I realised I was doing the last thing first - I needed to get them to the event before I filled them.

I approached her and we were cautious with each other, like we didn't know if it would go well between us or not. She was wearing a beautiful dress, black with 70s prints. I said how beautiful it was and there were other people there who echoed me, and there was a gentle truce between us. Then, I  went to the doctor's to do this study, to report my dreams and my thinking. I had got it wrong because you do it from your computer.

I mentioned it to someone passing by and they just sighed and said yes, the year sevens had been making jumpers. I thought it was strange because that absolutlely did not seem to answer why there were SO many pins everywhere, surely they couldn't have done that by accident in one class. I also thought it funny that noone tried to clean it up, or to stop them while they were doing it. I said, no one take their shoes off then.

The others planned where they wanted to go in NY, I wasn't able to though I was really keen to visit a comic shop.  We left the train and as we started our wander thru NY we were attacked by the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and shredder.

In there I saw my favourite comics writer and sometime e-mail chat friend Greg Rucka and an unknown artist. Sal and Greg told me the artist could help me, as his drawings were so realistic they affected the real world.  The artist drew a scene on which Raphael and Shredder fought on top of fast moving cars.  Looking outside we saw this scene playing out.

The game played out as follows:  Setting: Victorian London, a murder has taken place in a fancy hotel. I had travelled from Sydney to take part in a presentation on the recent Ackerman expedition to the South Pole. The murder was of a hotel maid and was unusual as she had drowned despite working in an upper level room.  The other investigators were an infamous ""detective"" whose reputation was much overestimated - he appeared to be a scruffy opium addict, a scientist from the expedition ( a woman, which was scandalous) and the hotel manager, an amateur astronomer/astrologer who had read an unusual horoscope on the night of the murder.

The classroom was very cramped. They were doing an exam or test or something. The fire alarm went off. There were a lot of stairs to go down. But they were more like stairs in a castle or church tower. Stone. Lots of spirals and short cuts and obscure Directions. I don’t remember if I ever made it to the bottom.   I was in an underwater place. Everything was underwater. I remember splashing in and out of this pool, gasping for air and resisting, before I succumbed to living down there. Lots of pastel sea colours. Lots of creamy yellow sand and seaweed door curtains. There were quite a few people down there. There was a sense that everyone had to pack up and move. I didn’t understand why I had to move when I’d just got there. I didn’t know where we were going. There were just boxes everywhere. A very skinny guy came in.

I was told by Mr Thorton That he thought it might be best if I go to the year below. I was wore a hat to school and didn’t want to take it off. Everyone else was piling into the school hall. It had just been renovated. A school leader told me to take my hat off. This made me cross and anxious. I felt vulnerable. Everyone was lookin  at my short hair. Someone got up and everyone was told to get into their surgery groups. I didn’t know what was happening. The girl I was sitting next to was kind and explained that it’s the project they’re doing at the moment. They have a pretend doctors surgery and they had to research the history of doctors as well as conduct their own - hire all the people, work out how much to order the equipment and running the bookings ect. My school friend Cat was sitting at the next table. I realised it was a joint 5/6 project. I thought maybe I could manage this after all. Cat disappeared though and when she came back she looked more like when we were in year 12. I suddenly remembered that was was meant to be in yr12 and only go back one year but now I seemed to be in yr 5. Had everyone brainwashed me or was I so stupid I had to go back to yr5? Cat came back and was trying to study for her exam. Rachel was begging Cat for a drink of water. She had 2,1 litre bTitles sitting on her table. She didn’t want to share her bottle but Rachel kept begging. Cat was so determined to deny Rachel the water she poured it over herself, in the middle of the school hall. Then I was called over by a teacher to come and read to her in the corner. I was so embarrassed I had to go read to her. She had to ask me twice to come. I got up and walked over but just as I got to the table I dramatically yelled, ‘I can’t do this!’ And collapsed into the table in a ball of tears. Everyone just stared at me. I hid my head in my arms and cried.   I was in the backyard of a house I didn’t know. There were lots of steps up to the house - maybe two flights. The grass I was standing on was synthetic and there was a big open shed to the side... maybe more like a tim roof with a back and clear plastic sides, no front - it was huge. I was wondering around in my school dress on the grass. It didn’t fit me anymore. Margaret was there. she said she suddenly had to go home. I was confused and thought we already were home. I turned around and I could suddenly see her getting on a train on a platform way above the shed. The platform was built on a sandstone wall. It was just your average metro melb train but when they were green, not blue. I was sad she had to go so suddenly and wondered if anyone else was going to come home. I did strangely think Marg was just taking a train on a scenic route to the front door. I was sure to beat her home. Then I realised there were all the instruments laid out - violins, violas, clarinets, flutes and a piano. Just as I thought made I would have a play of the violin , it started to rain and I thought I better get the instruments out of the rain. So I was running with over filled arms with instruments to the uncover of the shed. Once I got all the instruments there I thought I better play the violin but it just wasn’t the same and I was cold and soaked through. So I took of all my clothes, left them in the shed and climbed the many stairs to the house. Everything was very white. I put on a white singlet, like a men’s under singlet and some white men’s undies. I turned around and Emily was standing there. I was so surprised she was there. She asked me, ‘what are you doing?!’ At the same time I asked her, ‘how long have you been here?!’ Marg walked in the front door. Everything went black.   I was wandering around a University campus. Some parts were extremely old, like Ancient Greece or Rome and other parts were modern, like maybe built in the 80s and everything in between. Big buildings and very tight pathways between. It felt like a maze I was unfamiliar with. I seemed to be on a teamed scavenger hunt but I somehow had been separated from my group. I was finding things for the scavenger hunt but I had no way to record them. I walked into this chapel but it was more like the crypt. It was very dark and closed in, rough stone walls and ceiling. There was soft spot lighting shining on the ceiling where there were faded drawings, mostly in a clay red. They were stunning. I kept marvelling at it, leaving the chapel, thinking I’d try a different direction and a different door but I kept finding myself back in this chapel staring at the ceiling. I found a few members of my group just outside the chapel and asked if they’d seen the drawings inside. They said they hadn’t and so I took them in to show them. They said it was amazing, jotted it down in their notes and left. I didn’t feel like they appreciated it as much as they should have.   I was standing in Emily and Mick’s entrance to their house. A small brown puppy came bouncing over to me. He stared barking at me and said hello and tried to calm him without touching him. He started growling at me and I was very wary but tried to pat him, which he let me but was still agitated. I asked him what was up and if I was missing something. He continued to growl at me impatiently. I suggested to Mick that I take him for a walk so he can see I’m a fun person so have around. Mick went o get his lead but the postman suddenly opened the front door unexpectedly. The dog ran out and I ran after him. He ran next door where they had this red round plastic tub they’re turned into a garden bed full of cacti. The dog did a huge wee and I realised he was just trying to tell me he was absolutely busting. Mick came over and was pleased I got the dog but said I needed to be careful in this garden bed. Last time he was here it was full of lizards and snakes. The dog was now sniffing round the grass. And when I looked back at the bed I realised all the snakes and lizards were hiding under the rocks fairly camouflage.

I went into Bakers Delight. Some girls from my high in a few year below me were serving. I was feeling stressed with how many people were in there and everyone being so relaxed. I knew the people being served inform of me too but I didn’t speak to them, I was feeling too stressed to say hello. They left and I walked up to the counter. The BD people said a snide comment about the people in front of me. I screamed at them that i knew them and they might like to hold their tongues in front of customers. They looked embarrassed. Then I next door to BD. Was another room that was being rearranged. There were lots of people all shuffling about. I realised they were going to have some kind of meeting or talk and so I joined in. Then without evening starting the packed all the chairs away. I stood in a corner watching abstract baffled. I swear they were setting up and now they’re packing up. I suddenly realised I was standing a bit cramped in this corner between this wooden desk like the teacher desk at school and a smaller desk like wooden student desk at school. Behind me were some curtains. I Opened them and realised There was a beautiful beach outside. I opened the glass door and realised to get to the sea was this sheer drop of a sand dune. It was huge. But everyone else seems to just be chilling and jogging around it like it was flat. I thought it mustn’t be as steep as it looks. I took one step out and got in the way of some joggers and cyclists. I jumped out of the way, lost balance and fell down the hill. I was clinging on for dear life. I’m not sure what I was clinging to but I daren’t move. It was gorgeous sunny day out the beach side but down I was facing the other way it was night time in the other direction. I looked up for help, which didn’t come but there was a castle on a distant mountain with fireworks. I suppose it looked a bit like the Disney castle. I was mesmerised by it and couldn’t believe no one else was turning around to look at the fireworks. Looking at the fireworks seemed to make me forget that I was terrified of clinging to the steep hill. I seemed to suddenly be able to run inside to tell people there was fireworks but by the time I got inside I didn’t get a chance to tell anyone because they were all rushing about packing their suitcases and saying ‘we have to go. We have to go now.’ I didn’t know what was happening but everyone seemed quite panicked. I found my suitcase, which was already packed. But I realised I kept forgetting bits. So my arms were laden with odd bits and pieces. Carter was there and said she couldn’t come. I didn’t understand why. I gave her a hug and told her I hoped to see her soon. She said hopefully she’d finish whatever she had to do and follow shortly. I ran out to the corridor and I seemed to be on the ground floor of my primary school. I ran to the exit and a few teachers from my high school were there i told them id forgotten my face masks. I hadn’t packed any face masks. I dropped all my things and ran back tot he room but couldn’t find any. I knew we had to go so I ran back to my luggage. One of the teachers had bought me a pack of ten. She said she knew it wasn’t enough for three weeks but it would get me through a few days. We walked out the door of school and appeared to be going into the London underground. But when we got to the bottom of the escalator we were in the tarmac of the airport. There was a plane waiting for us with a staircase attached. I got on and realised I’d forgotten my card game Spot It. I knew exactly where it was and ran of the plane. When I found the pack of cards I realised there were other students who were on the plane yet. I asked them what they were doing and they were too scared to come. We had to be fast and I told them we could fly to the plane. And we did. I don’t know how we flew like superhero’s but we did. One of the guys id found fell from the sky mid flight. I felt guilty but there was no time to see if he was ok. The plane was due to leave. The other and I made it too the plane and I could see the other guy was ok and now running for the plane. But suddenly I was surrounded by police. The people who had just boarded the plane With me were arrested, as was I. I didn’t know why I was being handcuffed.

A group of kids were having a surf lesson but the waves were getting bigger and bigger. A woman in a white bikini, separate from the surf lesson on the sand was just heading out for a swim. It looked very dark and cold for a bikini. She dove into a wave and then kind of became the wave or was inside the wave. She had her arms out and legs together like a cross. The wave was in slow motion. It lifted her up, her back to the bank. It slowly flipped her backwards with the cube of the wave and then when she was upside it sped up and slammed her into the ground. She was then just a floating body in the sea. The kids were screaming and ran of. I panicked I’d be blamed for her death and the kids would find me in this room I didn’t know, so I hid under the covers. No one came for me.   I walked past a toy shop. I knew I shouldn’t go in, restriction say we shouldn’t. It was a lovely old toy shop with antique toys. I asked the man at The desk if he’d mind me having a look around. He indulged me. It was a bit cramped but I loved looking at everything. I was just about to leave when I saw a toy rabbit I actually had as a child. I was so excited and told the man. He smiled but then quickly wasn’t smiling. Then I realised I’d knocked a whole stand of toys over. I offered to pick them all up for him and as I was doing so, I kept finding more and more toys I recognised from my childhood. I had to stand on a ladder to put some back in the shelf. I was in the back seat of a car. My friend Clara was in the passenger seat and her boyfriend was driving the car. We were driving on country roads in the US. It was such a long drive and I kept dozing because I was so tired. I suddenly realised, despite it being night time, that there was orange glowing in the distance getting closer and closer. Panic entered me. I know what orange glowing means in the middle of the night. I told the guy driving we have to stop and turn around, fire is ahead. He shrugged me off and it was too late anyway, there were flames on the side of the road. I could see emergency services blocking the road ahead. He pulled over. Clara seemed to wake and asked why we were pulled over. The guy said he’d hit a sign and had to stop. He got out and walked over to the police blocking the road. Clara said she was struggling to breathe and opened the door. I screamed at her to shut the door. The smoke was getting into the car. She seemed to have forgotten what bushfires are like. I didn’t know how we’d got to California. I thought we were in New York. Had we really been driving for that long?! I remember screaming at Clara, ‘why is no one Fucking concerned that Australia and California have had the biggest fires they’ve ever seen IN THE SAME YEAR?!?!?’. Clara and I seemed to suddenly be at a beach house. White 50s weatherboard beach house. She said we had to find the dogs. And I was thinking ‘when the fuck did you get dogs?’ We finally found them and I was thinking, ‘oh are we looking after Cat’s dogs?’. The house was slightly oddly configured but there seemed to be eski’s full of bottles of soft drink. Clara kept cussing that her boyfriend had drunk all the bottles she liked.

We found a pub and went in. It was bustling with people. I bumped into two school friends. They were pleased to see me and couldn’t believe I’d made it for whoever’s birthday it was. I didn’t really know what they were talking about  but pretended I did. I turned around there was a big easel with a poster in it. It was in blurred colours brown and gold. Then I realise Jason Crawford was signing autographs just over there. I completely melted inside. I was just plucking up the courage to go over there when Clara came rushing over, ‘it’s time you go. If you want to catch ???? You have to go now!’ And she pushed me out the door without saying goodbye to anyone. I was very annoyed she wouldn’t let me say goodbye to anyone and didn’t understand the rush. I went to the car and thought about texting people goodbye but when I got to the car I realised the drivers door wasn’t quite shut properly. I shrugged it off and thought it would have been Clara when she went to get something out of my car. But then my car wouldn’t start, telling me a door was still open. So I lent over to the passenger side door, opened and closed. I realised it too was ajar. I thought it was a bit weird but I shrugged it off thinking Clara must have had trouble finding it. The car still said there was a door open. So I lent over to the passenger side Back door and it too was ajar. I was a bit concerned now that someone has ransacked my car. I just wanted to go home though so the car finally started and I backed out of the space in the carpark. It was a small carpark with only about a dozen cars and a laneway to enter and exit. I backed out and suddenly realised my brakes didn’t work. I started rolling backwards down this lane way. A few people ran out of the pub  and were screaming at me to stop and keep calm. They were going crazy yelling. I was a little panicked but I was keeping calm. Just trying to concentrate on steering the car and hoot the horn to get everyone out of the way. Then it’s like I blacked out and woke up finding myself in a tangled mess on the ground just outside the lane. It was dark and I was crying. There was a man loitering. I wasn’t sure if he’d already raped me or was about to. I found my phone and rang my parents to ask if they could come pick me up. They didn’t sound very interested by reluctantly said they’d come.

She was behaving slightly oddly but convinced us her apartment would be safe. So we followed her back. She told us to wait there, she had to go and pick up her daughter and get some food.

Could we really trust Clare? Clare’s parents arrived. They told us they were there for the professional development course.

I don’t remember much but I do remember feeling very tired, very lost and overwhelmed, very unsure And afraid. The stairs are significant. And there were lots of shadows. I was back at high school. I was at rowing training in the morning. Our warmup was a bit slow which made us come in late. I was worried about Lily. I couldn’t find her Once we’d come in. The coach told me I had to carry all this equipment back to school. So I walked back to school with all this equipment id never seen before. I suppose they were like oars but all different sizes and length and none of them useful. I had some with the girth bigger than you could use in a boat, difficult to carry. I also had a lots of tiny ones that I kept dropping. I finally got back to school and the corridors were very narrow. It was a challenge to walk down them with all the oars. I came through some double doors and the corridor smelt like a swimming pool and the walls and ceiling were this light pastel green colour. There was a huge crowd standing there, all looking at something. I was really struggling and I was dropping oars at all angles. I called out for some help but no one even turned. So I said to myself, ‘don’t worry [name], just put everything down, reorganise and go again.’ While I was reorganising the oars, someone came over and informed me that the crowd was the Aus netball competition and they weren’t happy we were late and packing up around them. I picked up the oars again and had to carry them through this crowd. I tried to be polite and crack a joke. The captain of the team, with arm crossed and in a very bitchy voice said, ‘good to see you’re studying hard.’ I got instantly mad and retorted, ‘oh would you like to help and carry these for me.’ She put her nose in the air and turned away. I had to wait briefly for the ball yo go out of bounds and the whistle gone to pause the game so I could run across it to the storage shed. I could feel the crowd livid with me. Once id got rid of the oars I went to the change rooms. There were a few people from my year level just chatting. The change rooms also seemed to be this green colour. I got to a big umm box thing. Huge. Built in. Like seamless with the floor but came up to about waist high and was about 1m wide and 2m long. It was some kind of bin and I put a few things in. I suddenly realised I was also carrying a small box. It was made of cardboard but looked nice. Like a gift box. It was pale pink. It had Barbara Streisand written in the top.

602,1441,0,,,9/4/20 14:58,04.09.2020,735,"I was trying to find a flat I used to live in in Hull, in Humberside, more than forty years ago. I walked past a house with the number 60 in large red letters, but I wasn't sure if that was the right number. It was in a row of Victorian terraced houses and it looked like the right one as there was an alleyway at the side. I walked to the end of the row and decided it must have been the right house so I walked back. I walked up the alleyway and turned into a much narrower alleyway as I remembered that if it was the right house it would lead to the back of the houses. I saw a fire escape at the back of the house, which I remembered from living there, so I knew it was the right one.  Then I seemed to be in a different house and someone showed me to a room which I was going to stay in. The room was quite small. I found myself downstairs sitting nest to a woman who I appeared to own the house. She was either showing me something or we were discussing the rent. I leaned towards her and put my fingers in her vagina. She enjoyed it so I continued until she had an orgasm.  I was then trying to get home and waited for a bus to take me to the station or the airport. I knew I had to get a number 2  bus. Several buses came together, one of which was a number 622, but none were a number 2. I decided to drive to the station or airport and some friends gave me lft to my flat to collect my things. They dropped me off at the corner of a street. I could see the street sign with the name of the street but I couldn't make out the name clearly. I was in a communal kitchen making a cup of tea, but I remarked that it was bigger and more modern than I remembered it. I found myself walking up some stairs to my room, which I hadn't used. The room was on the corner of a landing at the top of some stairs. A cleaner saw me and asked me who I was. I said I lived there.I tried to open the door to the room but the key wouldn't fit. Then I realized that it was the key to my home. I had several keys and found the right one, which was silver. Once inside I heard voices outside and someone knocked on my door. It was the cleaner asking for the rent.  I was driving home and decided to get some petrol as I had a long drive. I thought I would have enough petrol to get me home but I thought it would be safer to fill up anyway. I pulled into a large car park with a lot of empty bays. I had to swerve around some cars to get to the bays, but the only one which had a petrol pump was at the end, in the direction I'd just come from, so I had to turn around to get to it. There was a car already in the bay, but there was enough room for aother car, so I pulled in next to it. When I got out of my car I saw that the other car was a taxi - it had a red sign on top. A man was leaning out of the rear window of the taxi on the left hand side as I walked round to the front of it to get to the petrol pump. I had to stretch the hose in front of the taxi as I didn't want to damage the car. I found the filler cap on my car was low down at the front rather than at the back. This made it easier to put the hose in but I thought it was a bit strange as I had seen that on car before. Then I remembered that I'd changed my car. This one was white.   When I went to the kiosk to pay I said the petrol pump was number 1. The man in the kiosk said no it wasn't, implying  that there wasn't a pump with that number. Then I remembered it was number 4. He asked me something and showed me a printed card. I told him I didn't understand what he said so he gave me the card. It was an advertisement for something so I gave it back to him and said I wasn't interested. I paid with a credit card but he had to use tone of he old embossing machines. We talked about the new automatic system where you swiped your card, and I told him about someone I knew who said it was much easier and quicker so you could process more people in the same amount of time.  I wanted to get some CDs out of my bags so I could play some music on the drive home but I couldn't remember which bag they were in so I rummaged through all of them until I found them in a rack. I was then driving back, but instead of using the motorway I decided to take the scenic rout and go through York.",901,4,2,0,2,#NULL!,3-sep.-20,1,71,0,0,0,4,5,3,4,4,4,4,3,5,1,13,81,28,20,80,2.6,2.71,6,3,1.44,30.85,1.11,0.33,0.11,0.11,0,0,0,0,1,1,20.09,7.88,0.19,0.19,18.87,13.32,5.55,0.59,0.6,DD_Report_pruned,1,10.54,0.22,0.33,1.44,0.44,15.54,14.76,0,0.22

It was great to see the videos but also a bit embarrassing. We were in the alps or new zealand and joined some kind of dance class, or art exhibition. Or it might have been a party I was going with my mum where she'd chosen to wear huge shiny red platforms and I'd chosen to wear comfortable 'mum shoes'. She was definitely doing it to appear younger but it made going down the stairs very hard. At one point I was going to stay at an airbnb before realizing that it was someone's messy house where I would be sleeping on the floor all in one room with the whole family - this had been described in the ad but I missed it. I also joined a class and the class was full of children except for me. It started as learning to draw but moved onto learning how to program a sort of device like a modem except you could change the configuration of the lights and lines inside to make a character walk. This was a puzzle to solve, and I knew my friend Sam was also trying to solve it so I gave him a call while on the way to his house (the same airbnb house from before but it had changed into his house apparently) and tried to describe it, and it turned out the solution also had something to do with perspective drawing and that rule where something in the mirror is exactly half it's size in real life?

It was late at night. Mikael said he was going to go home,l. When he left I purchased a record I thought he might like and two big yellow earrings for me - I think my earring holes were closing and I needed to buy something that would keep them open. As I was making my way to the exit, a woman stopped me. She and her friends were drinking and partying in the part of the store next to the records. Somehow she started talking to me and showing me different t-shirts, all with slogans on them related to lesbian sex acts. I politely declined but she started following me, telling me I shouldn't be afraid and that lots of women were secretly lesbian. I kept declining and telling her no, thank you, I'm okay but she kept following me. She was drunk. The roads were busy as I started to walk home but she wouldn't leave me alone, even as I tried to dodge her and lose her and hide. All of her friends joined her and I tried to hide in the group to confuse her so she didn't know where I was or what direction I was going in. St one point I hid behind a bluestone wall as her group walked past. They then decided to turn around, back to the shop (all of them were loud, rambunctious and drunk). As each person walked past me, hiding against the wall, I kept thinking she would be next but she wasn't. Eventually I decided to make my escape, only to find she was on the other side of the wall waiting for me. I restrained her and tied her into a knot on a tree branch, before running away as fast as I could. I started cycling. I still had the record and the t-shirts and I was cycling erratically to get as far away as possible from her. By the time I got home, it was 11 am and I was so tired after being awake all night. I go to open the door quickly and bring my bike inside. As I lock the door behind me, I notice someone on the other side of the door. I panic. I think it's the woman and she's found me. I have my hand on the locked door handle to check she can't get in, and then peer through the door viewer. It's not the woman, it's Baddie Winkie, the famous Instagram star that's in her 90s and always posing in sensual pictures. I speak through the door and ask her what she wants. She returns that she saw one-off the t-shirts I was carrying with the slogan and thought it was good. She wanted to take a picture with it on for her Instagram and she was worth 3.5 million dollars. Reluctantly, I agree to help her quickly, even though I'm tired. As I open the door I tell her we'll take the picture in the laneway. I leave my front door open as we start walking, until I realise my two cats might try to escape. I'm right. Both are outside, near the front door. I quickly return and chase them in, one manages to run back but the other one is tricky and I end up handling her in a mean way. I feel guilty for doing it but I'm frustrated that all these obstacles are stopping me from getting into bed. I return to Baddie and she is finishing a cigarette. She throws it down, but it lands in a pole of dry sticks in my neighbours yard. I panic, watching the embers, and jump into his garden and start using my hands to scoop ash and dirt on to the pile to stop it from catching alight. After a few minutes Baddie gets impatient and I have to leave it as is, hoping that it doesn't catch fire and my efforts worked. Baddie has found an old taxable and she puts it in front of a corregated iron fence. She's wearing the white top and tight skinny jean trousers with a full face of make up and her midriff showing. She asks me to take photos on my Samsung. I do it, although I feel guilty because I would prefer to use my professional camera inside the house, but just want to get this over with quickly. The light is hard to fix She, because there's a lot of white and it's snowing. She poses alone for close ups, and with younger women. All of a sudden there are two men in the laneway catcalls us both. Baddie tells them off and they get angry and start threatening us, moving towards us. Baddie hops on to the neighbours fence and I make a run for it inside my house. As I do, one of the cats tries to escape and I get so frustrated. I try so hard to close my door - it's like the wind is pushing against it and making it hard to close - before I eventually manage it using the wine rack near the door to leverage my weight and force the door closed, all while I try to keep the cats from escaping. As I close the door I think about the value of the wine and an app shows up on my screen/in my view, rating each wine and telling me which ones have made it into the awards round that year. It even asks if I would like to add a vote for those that are in the running. I think the app is cool, and remark on how many wines I have are award quality.",979,2,3,0,2,2,3-sep.-20,0,29,1,1,0,3,4,3,3,4,3,4,4,4,3,28,52,24,22,101,2,2.14,8,7,3.58,14.62,1.53,2.04,1.84,0.41,1.43,0.41,0.31,0.41,0.61,0.61,19.2,7.46,0.39,0.39,19.92,15.73,4.19,0.5,0.5,DD_Report_pruned,1,9.6,0.61,0.1,4.7,0.72,14.91,5.52,4.29,1.23
604,1450,0,,,9/6/20 1:11,06.09.2020,730,"We're at a beautiful farm property in Gippsland. It's supposed be my parents-in-laws'. I'm there with my Mum and a few other friends and I'm nervous because it's Stage 3 lockdown and I'm worried the neighbour is going to call the police on us. Our host tells us that we're having a gathering the next night and we spend all day preparing. Oddly the house then becomes a house owned by my Aunt, she's not there, but she's in the process of building next to the home and a wall is completely missing. Beyond the wall is the construction of her new home - it's no more than a meter away. After setting up for the gathering, I go to find the shower and as I hunt for a towel (I open up a drawer and there's odd towels, pieces of cloth, and damp towels. I don't want to pick one towel that looks like a towel already hanging up on the rail - I think that towel is mt unclea and I'm repulsed in case he comes back and uses my towel accidentally. As I go towards the shower, I realise the shower has a direct view of the open wall and construction men can see in to. I'm frustrated that my Aunt could be so careless and start looking around for an option. I find another shower on the other side of the hallway that has some privacy, but it's clearly not one they often use so I need to go back to the other shower and grab shampoo and conditioner. By this time, I had already undressed and I'm wrapped in my towel as I cross the hall. I'm very self conscious that the construction men can see me. As I'm getting the products, out of the corner of my eye I see one of the other male guests start to head my way. I quickly return to the other shower and find that he's also trying to use the same shower. I manage to beat him to it and he's frustrated because he needs to shower too. I tell him I'll take two minutes, and rush through. When I turn off the shower, and as I'm about to grab my towel, he pushes aside the curtain and catches me naked. I'm really self conscious and angry. As I grab my towel, he oddly uses the opportunity to encourage me to shower with him. Although he is very handsome, and the thought flickers across my mind, I say no because I love my partner and It's something we do together. I also don't trust this man.  As I leave the shower I realise I need to use the toilet and can't find one - there's not a single toilet in the house. I'm confused and frustrated at my Aunt - wondering where on earth she pees?? The dream skips to the gathering, and we're all dressed up and ready for it. Again I'm nervous because we're not supposed to have people over and the neighbour might dob us in. All of a sudden the whole town is there - it's packed - and it turns into a house party. I start to get really worried about Coronavirus, and that I might catch it from someone who's supposed to he self isolating. I tell one of my friends this and a guest overhears. He jokes that he's supposed to be self isolating. Even though he's joking I don't believe him - this is thr first gathering in months and everyone wants to be here. There's photographers and videographers and lots of food and wine. I decide to try and escape to one of the bedrooms, even though the party is still raging on. I jump into the bed - it's just the bed and some odd, purple doors that I hate, and take down my hair - it's been in three buns and it's really wavy. I feel like myself again as I do it - I didn't like the hairstyle and I'm uncomfortable in all the make-up. My friend comes in to check in me, and I'm explaining how I feel as a male guest aslo leans against the doors to listen. The dream jumps to the wedding of the friend that was in my doorway - she's about to marry the guy that walked in on me in the shower on a landing outside, extended out of the beach- almost like a pier. Again there are so many guests here and I'm worried that people on the beach will see us and call the police. I'm also unhappy because I don't like her future husband - he only cares about himself. She's in a beautiful dress, with cut outs and tan/white elements and I'm watching the wedding from her perspective. As she walks down the isle, her husband tells the musicians to stop playing. It's awkward but she makes it to the stand okay. He then tells every guest to sign s book - they can't hug her - but it's to prove that they were witnesses. She stands alone to the side of a table as each of her friends in pairs come up to the table. She can see they're happy for her, but they can't express it by touching or hugging her. At one point another male guest stares at her hard, and she realises that he can see her nipper through one of the cut out sections of the dress - it's moved during the ceremony. She's uncomfortable. It's then time for her Grannie to come to the table. She's 96 and she's trying to get to the table but my Mum refuses to help her. Grannie is upset she's not being helped, but she's muttering in South Korean. My Mum sits there stonyfaced. It turns out that Grabboe is not her Grannie, but her good friend's mother. We call her Auntie. Auntie is the mother of the bride, but very selfish. Auntie goes into help and they walk up to the table together. I'm standing to the side, where the bride was, and I'm accompanied by the male guest from the party fhe night before - the one that listened as I worried about Coronavirus. We've become close, but we're not partners. Grannie asks Auntie for her gift. Everyone gets angry because they think Aubtie hasn't got a gift for her own family's wedding. My Mum says it's typical - every time Mum has given Auntie a necklace or piece of jewelry - a priceless piece - Auntie has sold it for her own purposes. For drinking, houses, games. Auntie says it's not true and leaves Grannie to go and get a gift. She returns with two ancestral South Korean earrings. They're bright blue circles with beads hanging from the centre circle. She puts one of my companions ear, and gives the other to me. The wedding party is speechless. My Mum moves to stand and walks out a door without a word. Upset, I follow her. As I opened the same door that she and my Auntie had used, it turns into a beautiful hallway with necklaces and jewelry hanging from hooks on the wall. The hallway is so long. I catch up to my Mother and she tells me (she is a famous jewelry maker and businesswomen) that Aubtie stole the earrings from her collection. She points to where. She then picks out two items - one is a purple pattern and the other is red. She turns them into a fabric that dresses this huge group of people, who are supposed to be her army/dolls. It's magical.",1261,2,3,0,2,2,3-sep.-20,0,29,1,1,0,3,4,3,3,4,3,4,4,4,3,28,52,24,22,101,2,2.14,8,7,4.76,22.2,2.46,2.3,1.82,0.24,1.59,0.48,0.56,0.16,0.25,0.25,19.11,9.52,0.49,0.49,18.72,14.2,4.52,0.37,0.37,DD_Report_pruned,1,7.22,1.11,0,5,0.71,14.75,1.74,10.23,1.67
604,1448,0,,,9/4/20 0:45,04.09.2020,715,"There's some link to a colleague I ran an event with today, he walks inside a big cafe/restaurant after seeing me and he's nervous about a new client meeting he has. The dream starts as a small class I'm in, and the teacher tells us that we have an assignment on memory recall. To do the assignment, we have to neet her at this Cafe. I'm the first one, and as I try to walk into the cafe there's something wrong with my feet - they're really heavy, and I'm painfully shuffling to the right where a small table has been set up with my teacher and her colleague. The table is tiny and I remember being frustrated that I couldn't walk up to the table properly and in front of them, and that when I sat down, it felt tight - we were crammed into this corner with a tiny round table and a few papers on it. My teacher's colleague asked me if I had flat feet. I was surprised he asked and said I didn't think so. And he then said he did, it's okay. They then pulled off my rainbow- I was embarrassed because my feet might have been smelly. When I got the boot back on, they were asking me these odd personal questions about my life. I felt uncomfortable and wondered if it was part of the assignment. When my classmate walks in to the cafe for his turn - he's a big, older man - I stand up, guide him, and give him my seat. He almost ignores me and starts talking about his time in Indonesia. I try to join in and share that I was also in Indonesia but he doesn't look at me or acknowledge me. I walk out of the cafe and feel aimless. I sit down outside - there are people around and different types of seats - the kind you see in parks, made of stone or wood. I walk to the edge of the courtyard and pick a chair with a back. I'm tired and I just want to sit down and scroll on my phone. I'm sitting very close to the road, which is uncomfortable but I care about sitting in that seat more. When I sit down, a girl joins me in a seat slightly to the front of me. She's very close and I get worried about Coronavirus. I drop my pen, I'm rummaging in my bag for something, and she picks it up. I let her keep it. I'm worried I'll catch Coronavirus. I get up and that's when I see my colleague from the cafe. The fream changes, and that's when the repeat part of the dream starts. I am watching a mad man wreck havoc in the same cafe. He's smashing glass, throwing it at people, hurting people. It's uncomfortable and I'm afraid but weirdly people see him as this demi-God. Like what he's doing is okay because he represents something or someone. When he leaves/I leave the cafe, his girlfriend joins the dream thread. She's the cafe owners' daughter. I don't think she should be his girlfriend, but over the course of the dream I realise why it's okay. They're both crazy. She is an artist - she sketches - and her sketches are very upsetting. The repeat part of the dream ends here. I walk into a public toilet, the stall is very long. I sit down to wee, it's hard, when the stallholder next to me starts talking to me. I'm frustrated and curious at the same time and they tell mr about themselves and a video I need to watch of them. They start playing the video and ask me, can I see it? I lie that I can. The girlfriend then walks in and I'm worried. She wants to take a picture of her boyfriend - the crazy guy from the cafe. I help her get a picture with a good background. The rest of the dream is me watching their crazy life - how they got together, how the relationship turns sour and how they hurt people, how he dies and how she died afterwards. It's painful and upsetting to watch, and I'm frustrated that their behaviour is acceptable - that people don't try to challenge them. I wake up in a final scene, after he and her had been on a carpet ride (he had died somehow after this, I think she is to blame). She is on a 4x4 on his property - it's like the desert - and starts going crazy. She's restrained by someone and I'm relieved. And then it cuts to a scene where she's helping young kids - she is in dark blue with platform heels, and after she helps this little boy she steps inside a Jean material backpack and the little boy and his Mum think it's so cool but I know it's malicious and I'm frustrated that everyone thinks she's okay.",824,1,4,0,2,#NULL!,3-sep.-20,0,29,1,1,0,3,4,3,3,4,3,4,4,4,3,28,52,24,22,101,2,2.14,8,7,5.46,7.25,1.7,3.16,3.4,0.12,2.67,0.61,0.73,0.24,0.31,0.31,19.9,9.83,0.47,0.47,22.45,17.48,4.98,0.39,0.39,DD_Report_pruned,1,9.34,0.49,0.12,5.83,1.7,12.99,3.4,9.34,0.73

616,1507,0,,,9/19/20 3:40,19.09.2020,840,"I was needing to sort something out.  there was something I needed to find, or someone I needed to talk to.  I woke up and remembered having a dream that had reminded me that I needed to find this thing out.  I was lying on my bed, which was more like a mattress on the floor.  I was there alone. I sort of rolled off the mattress to get up.  It was daylight, I was in a bedroom with bright light shining in the window and I was trying to remember the dream so I could get more details about what it was I needed to find out.  In the dream I had been having I'd been sorting things into lists and I had discovered that something was missing and I needed to find it out before I could continue.  The next thing I know, it's getting dark and I'm outside in a street that looked like many of the inner suburban streets around here, lots of Victorian era workers cottages side by side, some blue stone cobblestones in the gutters or along the edge of the footpath.  I was with a couple of people now, and I knew that I had asked them to help me find out whatever it was that I needed to find out. I don't know who they were.  It was like someone had just put us together in a team to go find this thing.  The next thing I know, we're all in some sort of contraption that's like a buggy, but it wasn't being pulled by a horse. It seemed like a big trike, and someone was peddling in front, and I was siting in the back with someone.  I realised that we needed to hurry, because it was now completely dark, which meant that it might have been after curfew.  I started to worry that we would be seen and get into trouble.  I said something to the others on the trike about needing to hurry, or to get inside where we couldn't be seen.  We now seemed to know where it was we needed to go to find the thing we were looking for and were heading there purposefully - travelling through the dark, mostly deserted streets of Carlton, near Melb Uni.  So we're riding through the streets.  It was like it had just rained, the streets seemed wet, with the street lights reflecting off the glistening blue stone, and bitumen on the road.   Then I turned to look at the person sitting next me and suddenly realised that it was Jenny, my old boss from several years ago. she looked pretty much the same as she used to, her hair was longer, and her face seemed a bit more lined, so older.  I exclaimed ""Hey, Jen!"" ""I didn't realise it was you"". ""How are you?, What have you been up to?"".  She looked at me with something of a forlorn look and said ""He tried to make me have another one"".  I said ""another one?  Another one of what?"".  She then started just speaking. It was like she had been keeping all this stuff locked up inside her and hadn't been able to tell anyone. She didn't seem particularly upset though. She was just talking, almost in a monotone, and I was feeling very confused.  I was trying to follow what she was saying.  Eventually, I realised she was talking about having another baby.  And then I felt shocked. I'm pretty sure she's a few years older than me, and I'm 51!  So I was even more confused.  I said ""What??! How is that even possible?  You must be in your 50s aren't you?  How could you possibly have a baby?"".  She looked at me sadly, and also a bit condescendingly and said something like, 'if you have enough money, anything is possible'. It didn't seem like she was thrilled with idea.  I knew she already had 2 kids. One of them is about the same age as my younger son, and her older child would be in uni now. I asked her how she felt about it, did she want to have another one?  She said ""I'm not sure I have a choice"", ""It's what he wants"". The strange thing was, I couldn't tell if she meant, this was something that was happening now, that he wanted her to have a baby, or that it had already happened, and she did have another baby.  And then my attention was drawn back to the fact that we were sitting in this trike, riding through the streets and that we still needed to find that damn thing that I needed to find.  I felt bad that I couldn't spend longer talking to her and comforting her, but we needed to get inside and the place we'd been heading to was just around the corner.  I needed to tell the person steering where to go.  Which I did, and then we pulled up in front of this house. It was all dark.  There was a small front yard, with lots of dense bushes. I couldn't see what sort because it was very dark now. The house was a typical Victorian or maybe Federation building, not a plain as most of the cottages around it because it had tuck-pointed brickwork, and some different coloured bricks around the window at the front. It was single fronted, and had a big dark wooden door with a leadlight above it.  It was dark inside, the street was very quiet. None of the neighbouring houses seemed to have lights on either. It seemed way too dark for the time of night I thought it was.   I tried the door.  It opened slowly and silently. I started to feel optimistic. We had managed to get here without getting in trouble for breaking curfew.  Some of us might have even been further than the 5km from home we're allowed to travel.  I didn't need to worry about that. I knew that my mum's place was within my 5kms, and this place was closer to that.  I started to wonder where I needed to look for this thing.  I think it was something digital, so I was going to need to find a computer.  I opened the first door I came to in the corridor that the front door had opened onto.  It was a very typical hallway for the type of house this was. I walked into the room off the corridor.  It was facing the street and the curtains were pulled apart a bit so I could see out into the street. I saw Jenny standing out on the footpath looking around like she was in a bit of a daze. I felt sorry for her, and a bit outraged that her husband had tried to get her to have another baby at her age. But I had to remind myself that she was a strong woman and that if she really hadn't wanted to go along with it, then I was sure she could have handled herself and said no.  So I turned back to the room and saw a computer sitting on a desk.  It was a big wooden desk, and the computer looked old.  With a CRT monitor rather than the modern LED ones. so it had that big back on it like they used to.  I went over and turned on the computer and sat down at the desk and once the screen came to life I started hunting around for what it was that I had been looking for.  I think I found an excel spreadsheet and was trying to work out if this was the thing that I'd been looking for. sorting things into lists in an effort to find something in particular - that I was needing to remind myself of something, remember how to do something so that when it came time to do it again, I'd know how to.  telling myself to remember what I'd just been dreaming about so I could write it in this diary.",1346,2,2,0,2,#NULL!,13-sep.-20,0,51,1,1,0,3,4,2,3,5,3,4,3,4,2,26,42,29,18,97,3,3.14,2,1,1.71,16.03,0.59,0.97,0.97,0.22,0.67,0.15,0.07,0.22,0.88,0.88,24.37,11.89,0.41,0.41,22.21,12.18,10.03,0.65,0.65,DD_Report_pruned,1,7.13,1.26,0.59,2.82,0.3,15.53,14.19,2.01,0.59

There were fairly high cliffs of stone and then sand down to the ocean, which was fairly calm, with just small waves. It was late afternoon and my friend and I were just strolling along talking. As often happens in my dreams, we realised after some time had passed that the tide had come in, and we were unable to return back the way we had come. Usually when this happens in my dreams I start feeling very anxious and scared about how I""m going to get back but this time I wasn't. I just said to my friend, we're going to have to go up into the streets and walk back that way. They agreed. I can't even remember if it was a man or a woman. I think it was probably a woman. The cliffs must have ended because there was a gentle slope up off the beach now and we headed that way. So we left the beach and then we're suddenly in quite a busy street, with lots of street stalls and traffic and it was now night, so cars had their headlights on and the street lights and shops were all lit up.

Some people got in my way and so I couldn't keep my eyes on my husband. Once the scene cleared again, the woman was gone and he had started to walk away.

I ran to catch up to him, and started asked him about the woman he'd been talking to. He seemed genuinely confused about what I was talking about. He said that he hadn't been talking to anyone from his work. I started feeling confused and tried to get him to just think about the last few minutes, who had he bumped into, did he talk to any woman at all?

I say it looked like a fox, but it was slightly different.  It was sort of yellowy and not quite as big as a fox should be but it did have a bushy tail.  It tried to come into the open doorway I was approaching, but I shooed it on and it stayed outside.  Then I heard voices outside.  They sounded like they were urging a dog to chase the fox saying things like 'go on', 'go on, get it!'.  Then this huge dog rounded the corner of the verandah going in the same direction as the fox. it scrabbled on the boards, trying to find purchase and then came running towards me, sniffing furiously.

We were wandering around the town trying to find something to do and we ended up walking a long way, to this strange venue where a sort of magic / cabaret stage show was happening. We were watching a kind of burlesque escapology act, where several people were tied to large wooden boards standing up on the stage (like then they do knife throwing at the circus). In the finale of the show, something went wrong because one of the boards fell backwards straight on to one of the other performers. She was fine, but the accident triggered some sort of riot, which quickly descended in to chaos. The police arrived and were chasing people and we were trying to work out what to do. It was a really long way to walk back in the dark, especially through all the chaos, and one of my friends, Julia, from school appeared and said she would give me a lift in her car. A small group of us started walking to the car, then I remembered that I had promised Julia (who was apparently two people at this point!) that I would get a lift back with her. Everyone got confused and a bit annoyed about disruption to the plans, as I decided that I needed to go back and find the 'other' Julia.   We managed to get back and we were at our accommodation and I was tying to prepare for an online class that I needed to give some of my own students.

I recall feeling he was extremely unhappy. That he needed love & support.  We left the room and were walking outside. Indeterminable place. Lots of young people around us.

The small bedroom also had clothes and a dishevelled bed so it definitely belonged to someone else. The other boy was exhausted; there was something about a drop of water which was very significant. He had to fall asleep as he was exhausted. Next scene I was with an odd group of people at night-time taking them to a big hall to eat. It felt like a celebration.

A woman is showing us the dark room with two separate beds. She asks us to collect the hair that we are losing every day in a paper bag and fill in a form for each of it. Because it’s for a good cause, I do it. On the first day I fill the form in, on the second, i only collect the hair and on the third day, just before the time that we have to leave, I remember that i still have to fill in the form for today, the third day and yesterday. However, when I look at the form it seems too much work and I finally decide that I won’t fill it in and that the first one will have to do. We are waiting for the owner before we can leave and I am worried, because it’s already in the afternoon . How  would we get to our next destination which is many kilometers away. There is no train station here and if there was a bus, it would probably leave to our new destination  only once per week and it would surely leave in the morning rather than in the afternoon. Should we ask the young fellows who pick us up to drive us to the station to drive us the couple of hundred kilometers to our next destination? But that would be too far. We could not really ask them to do so and how could we ask them and would that bring us in danger? There is still some waiting time left before we meet the landlady and I have to go to the bathroom. She is there in one of the cubicles, but I can’t really recognize her. She looks completely different. She looks young, thin, black hair. However, she recognizes me. She apologizes for the bad condition that the bathroom is in, inexplicable to her how it had happened, because a wall between two  cubicles has disappeared as well as the doors of these. As the other cubicles  have closed doors, I am prepared to use one of the toilets openly visible to everyone, even in sight of the two young guys who hang around at a table to wait to drop us off later at the station. They chat with each other and don’t pay attention anyway. So I pull down my pants and have a quick wee. I go back to the room and my fellow female traveler has already packed her super heavy and bulky bag. I am wondering why her luggage is so heavy. She is proud she has packed it already and so timely. This would speed up our departure. I am starting to pack mine, I am traveling light with s small rucksack, and think about the purpose of the hair collection. I continue to worry about how to get to the destination. I have heard it’s a nice small city and it is conveniently located to reach other destinations from there, probably by bus and train.

716,1676,0,,,9/16/20 23:52,17.09.2020,615,"I was entering a very old theatre. I went there because I was singing in a choir concert. The theatre hall was empty when I entered it from the top. I walked down the stairs on the left side towards the seats for the audience. I remembered now that I had been here before performing in another concert and I remember that it had been difficult or that I had felt unsafe leaving my belongings at a supposedly safe place.  I had not trusted for them to be locked away somewhere far away from the stage. While I am contemplating where I could hide my belongings  before getting changed into my black clothes some other choir members appear and sit down randomly in seats many in a distance to others. When I feel it is time to find the change room, I decide to put the dog that I brought into a cardboard box not too far away from the stage but in a different room to be safe as I couldn’t bring it anywhere without complaints by others for the inappropriateness of having brought him in the first place. I know he will be fine in the box and I can retrieve him after the concert. When getting changed somewhere in the labyrinth of the theatre, I realized, I had forgotten to bring a black top. I only brought annoyingly a very white one. I know I would stand out in the choir which would be unacceptable.  I am finding other jackets in boxes which seemed to be abandoned, some suitable some not. I find a smoking jacket which I quite like. When I enter the change room I hear the rumor that the conductor had lost his smoking somewhere in the theatre. I check my box and can see the conductor stick in there and realize it must be his box. He had already dressed in a tight dark violet suit and is quite happy with the solution. I still pass  the smoking to an assistant which he takes, saying thanks but the conductor being still very happy with the way he looks will probably not use his smoking jacket.  I eventually decide to keep on my black winter jacket which unfortunately has some fur attached to the hood and will most definitely be way too hot on stage. But I think this must do. I am hurrying  back to the hall and the audience had arrived and the concert was just about to start. I was pushing myself through the audience with my handbag looking still for a safe place for it but time was running out. I rush embarrassed with my inappropriate look to my spot to sing. We strangely sang with the back to the audience.  At the end of he concert when most people had disappeared I went on the search for the dog in the box. But I couldn’t remember where it was. It wasn’t where I had thought I had left it behind. I open many boxes even in rooms where I was pretty sure I hadn’t entered before but I can’t find him anywhere. I feel so bad because a friend had entrusted the dog in my care. I try anxiously to find the dog, trying to hear a sound, a scratch or a bark but then the dog had probably fallen asleep with the lack of oxygen inside the box.

Then I was on some kind of art school trip. I was wearing my old school uniform and I was with my two school friends Nat and Manny. Manny, Nat and I bought tickets to an exhibition in the Gallery we were visiting. The gallery was in a large garden that looked a lot like Wisley Garden. We met the art teachers and they told us that they wanted us to paint. We painted for a bit then snuck off to the exhibit. Then I was with my mum and some other people I didn't really know. We were visiting these kind of museums about the people's lives. There was a boy with me, he looked like Joseph Gordon-Levitt. His museum was about chemistry. There was one room which had dark walls and a kind of red skylight. The room had an empty bathtub. The boy and I sat in it, I was behind him and he sat in between my legs. We were both facing one direction which had a TV screen and it was playing a movie. I felt like it would be a movie I wouldn't like. We got up and left. The rest of the group weren't with us in this room. Then we were going to my museum. I noticed at this point that I didn't look like myself, I looked like the character Elanor from the Good Place, played by Kirsten Bell. My museum was a pyramid with a giant statue of me on top. I entered my museum by going through the eye of the statue. There was another statue near the eye, it was also of me (Kirsten Bell) and it wanted to check it was me. When it confirmed it was me it let me into the eye. The others from the group were there. We were in big room with a wooden floor and light coloured walls. There was a TV on one side on a small metal and glass stand and there were a lot of chairs facing the TV. The boy who looked like Joseph Gordon-Levitt and I sat at the back of the room and I rested my head on his shoulder and he had his arm around me. The movie ended and I was talking to the boy and we were laughing and really happy. I remember that he was wearing a denim jacket and the material felt exactly the same as a denim jacket I have. I didn't notice that we were blocking the way out for the lady and girl on the other side of us. My mum alerted us and we apologised and moved. We followed some lady downstairs, she was really tall and Jennifer Lopez was walking next to her. I wanted to talk to Jennifer Lopez about a collaboration she did with Jimmy Choo I didn't want to seem like a weird mega fan so I didn't ask Jennifer Lopez about it. I overtook her and the tall lady and ran down the stairs really quickly. There were toilet cubicles. The boy went to use the toilet and I decided I should too. The toilet I went into hadn't been flushed so I flushed it.",564,3,3,0,2,3,14-sep.-20,1,27,1,1,0,1,4,2,4,4,2,4,3,4,2,11,56,24,34,91,2,2,11,5,1.42,35.29,1.24,0.18,0.53,0.53,0,0,0,0,0.99,0.99,18.26,9.04,0.4,0.4,18.97,14.89,4.08,0.69,0.7,DD_Report_pruned,1,8.87,3.01,0,2.48,0.35,13.65,13.48,0.18,0.53

She told me mostly good stuff and then she said that love was coming in quickly (she pulled the knight of cups and clarified with the knight of swords) and I started crying. There was a fat golden retriever in the room. We then went and walked round the town we were in. We came across a wedding dress shop and we looked in through the window. I asked her if she knew what her wedding dress would look like and she told me no. I told her that I’d been certain I’d marry one person I had been with so I had picked out a dress when I was with them. We continued walking and went to some kind of old temple. I think I met my parents there. We went back home and for some reason my dad was walking behind a crow around the house. I shooed it outside but then it came back in with another bird. My dad seemed to like them and told me not to shoo them out but I told him that they might carry diseases or something. I was paragliding. I was waiting for my turn to take off and the person in front of me was a little to over zealous and they almost did a full loop with their glider.,249,4,2,0,2,4,14-sep.-20,1,27,1,1,0,1,4,2,4,4,2,4,3,4,2,11,56,24,34,91,2,2,11,5,2.01,37.57,1.61,0.4,1.2,0.8,0.4,0,0,0.4,1,1,20.88,7.63,0.48,0.48,22.89,19.28,3.61,0.74,0.74,DD_Report_pruned,1,10.04,2.41,0,4.42,2.41,14.86,14.46,0,0.4

She said that we had to buy like 3 bags of jelly babies and I was a little annoyed because people could easily buy those themselves. It was really hot and we wondered how much an Uber back would cost. The app said £27. We walked past a few restaurants with people sitting outside. We then were in a shopping centre. I saw some Mauritian people I know sitting outside. I stopped to say hello and they asked about my mum and looked concerned. At another point in my dream I was teaching at my more rural school in japan. I brought a rabbit with me and I gave it to the class. We put it in a cage at the back of the class but it escaped. Some girl was screaming I picked it up and put it back and explained that it likes quiet. The kids got on with a worksheet but then this girl stood up and asked who took some lip gloss she had. One of the kids near me said they did and gave it back. The girl that asked for the lipgloss explained that she was new and hoped that they would all get along. We continued class and another teacher and I talked to the students about how to take care of the rabbit and mentioned how you should watch it properly when you’re outside.

Then I was in my room I noticed something moving on my desk. As if for attention.   I was camping with my friends. I know one friend Natalie was definitely there. I think some other friends from secondary school like Isabella and Alice  and Anastasia were also there. It was raining and the tent fell down but we carried on sleeping. It was really muddy. I wanted to get cleaned up the next morning but the campsite toilets were absolutely disgusting.   I was with my friends elsewhere and we saw skrillex. I wanted to meet him but I was too shy and didn’t want to disrupt the event. My friend snuck into his meet and greet line and then afterwards snuck all of us to his place and had some sort of contest with skrillex’s Friends so I could meet him. My friends seemed to have caused havoc so I went in and I apologised to skrillex. We had a chat and it seemed like he was under a lot of pressure so I gave him a hug and told him I knew he’d be ok and he didn’t have to work so hard it would all work out well. He started crying and said no one had listened to him before. I told him he could talk to me anytime and I gave him my number. he asked if I wanted to go swimming. I said sure so we ran through this forested beach path down to the ocean and we swam around together. We climbed up some orange coral which was kind of a square and jumped in the water. I could see octopus tentacles. Then I saw some kind of blimp with a timer land near us. It was a bomb so we swam to the beach and climbed these stairs. We heard the bomb go off and I told him to stop on a ledge not the stairs. So we listened. For some reason the ledge has some clear doors, I think for an elevator. I pressed the button and the doors opened and there was some kind of military event by a palace. Some man was called up and told to come through the doors with us. He was brown and he had like a carry case for a painting.

Someone I didn’t know was driving. They did like a 3 point turn and drove up a narrow mountain road. There was this very cute town with all these apple trees. I took photos of all the trees. They were growing from the insides of people’s houses and there were big windows so you could see the apple tree growing through the house. Then I was on a plane or a ship with my parents. I don’t know where we were going. We were watching tv. I got a letter and it said something about plagiarism. There was a form and the name josh was underlined in red.

She didn’t want my dad to see so she saw him and told me to go away. Then I was with my best friend  (Tirion) and we were in our old school hall for some kind of fair. There was a man under a blanket who’d freak people out. At the back of the school hall my friend from japan Tom and two other people were putting on a play. We went outside and it was raining. There was a charity shop and they’d left some toys outside which were getting wet. One of the toys was a totoro from the Japanese film my neighbour totoro. I felt bad because when I tried to get into the shop I might have got some of the toys even more wet. When we were in the shop the clothes and shoes got more fashionable. My best friend and I looked at these really nice boots but then went to get some snacks for lunch. We got some crisps and some cake bars. I was indecisive about which cake bar I would get. I wanted to get a brownie one at first but I decided it looked too unhealthy so I got a chocolate chip one instead. Then we went to pay. It was boots and we did self check out. My best friend then recommended these machines which could give you face treatments so we tried to work them out but she had to get back to work. I started to walk home.

I was running along the beach and the train came. I hoped it wouldn’t hit her. It derailed near her and hit some families opposite her. I was a man. next, I was myself. I was with my best friend (T) and some other people at a pub. It was new year’s Eve. I remembered it would be hard to get the train home so I went to the train station. I was with a friend from university, he’s called mikey. I could see the train I needed to take was on platform seven but I hesitated to go to the platform because I was thinking about my ex for some reason. It seemed like time froze. Everyone stood still. Then I was walking at night through some neighbourhoods. People were still up and drinking. I went in a shopping centre and I found a store doing a sale. I really wanted some shoes. There was also a dress I liked and I needed a third item to get the discount. I kept looking but the lady who owned the store said she had to close it so I bought nothing. Then I was in an apartment with friends. We didn’t know what to eat so I told them to get kfc. They went out to get it and returned with chicken nuggets. We ate them. But then we were a family and we were joking around doing impressions of one another. My son did and impression of me  I realised that he (my son) was growing up and wouldn’t always be around to have fun with me. That made me sad. Then I was reading an article about vampires. There was a picture of a man with three nude women. Two had their legs spread and they looked scared. Their vaginas were blurred out. The man was a vampire and looked directly at the camera smirking. I wondered to myself why they always have to sexualise women. At some point as well I was in a park in London and I rented a bike. It was a little big for me so I was having trouble pedalling. Some old man helped me and I cycled round the park in some sort of race. People were clapping which made me feel uncomfortable because I started the race at a different point to everyone else.

The bridge seemed to have an inside and outside, and you could walk along either part. I was walking along the inside, the bridge was white metal, very ornate, but very steep and slippery and I had to hold on to the edge bits to stop myself from falling.

I said I was sorry that I was just walking through, and she offered me a free piece of confectionary from a basket - there were chocolates and also some clear animal shapes. She said most people chose the chocolate praline but the clear ones were special, so I chose a clear pig (like a glass flat pig). I bit into it and it was so delicious, like fondant or praline, but completely clear.

We went over to a white and blue plane parked up on a stand, and went up the steps, and then pulled on orange cords to pull the steps up and close the door, and the other guy turned the door lever 90 degrees. We went into the cockpit (there was no door to get in, it was open access) and the other guy sat down in the left seat, and I took the right hand side seat, and we both strapped in and put headsets on.  The other guy was talking through what he was doing, and flicked a load of switches, and all the avionics lit up, and gauges and dials stabilised, and then there was a whining noise then engine roar.  The other guy taxied us out, and got us lined up with the runway, and stopped at the yellow solid hold markings. I recall all the taxi lighting on the way there, it was only a short taxi, as it's a small airfield. The edge lighting, centre line lighting, blue taxi lighting off the runway further up and the red end of runway lights, and the hold/centre line markings were all vivid and visible.  A bit more commentary from the other guy, and it was my turn to take over the aircraft. I had the yoke, and my feet on the pedals, and the other guy throttled up, and we started going faster and faster, and I pulled back and we took off and started climbing, and the other guy flicked the undercarriage and other switches  I could see houses and roads with cars with their lights on, and the far away grey silhouette of some hills, and I realised I was flying the plane, but it was a jet rather than a light aircraft, so something was off, so it was 100% a dream.

She wanted to give an example of how racism works, choosing a group of people by an arbitrary characteristic and then treat them differently because of it. I went out of the room after class with my friends and I was very upset by it all. Not because she threatened to fail us but by the fact that this is how people in the world sometimes treat each other. I started crying and my friends alerted our teacher who then came over and talked to me.",130,1,4,0,2,2,29-nov.-20,1,32,1,1,0,2,3,3,5,4,3,4,2,3,1,29,88,33,27,108,2.2,2.29,3,16,5.38,12.23,2.31,3.08,3.85,2.31,1.54,0,0,1.54,0.79,0.79,11.54,4.62,0.53,0.53,18.46,14.62,3.85,0.66,0.66,DD_Report_pruned,1,6.15,3.85,0,2.31,0.77,15.38,8.46,2.31,0
