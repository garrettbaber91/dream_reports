"I was with some people I do not know celebrating. There was a balcony over the side of a cliff that was very dangerous. People were doing stunts on the balcony (walking on their hands on the railing, etc) while everyone watched and cheered. Then someone fell, but it turns out there was a grassy hill not far down below that they safely landed on and seemingly planned to do so. Everyone cheered, and then everyone jumped down onto the hill to play these weird extreme sports, like tossing objects into the air and someone else shooting them down with a bow and arrow. There was a row of minifridges with drinks in them, one of them was mine. My parents showed up at the end to get me and my dad was having trouble moving my minifridge. That's all I remember."
I woke up and pulled my covers away and there were two bunnies and a rat in my bed under sheets
"It's recurring i remember having it a few times before but slightly different each time. It's my friends house in real life but in the dream it was very strange and is called the ""green room"" (even though its a house idk).
