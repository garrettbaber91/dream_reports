1,1,2,ak06ku,2,anna_kane@ku.edu,NA,7,1,NA,1,NA,5,NA,1,NA,1,"I find myself standing on the edge of a vast, tranquil lake. The surface of the water is perfectly still, reflecting the sky above like a mirror. The air is warm, and the scent of flowers and fresh grass fills my lungs with every breath. The sun is low on the horizon, casting a soft, golden glow over everything, turning the water into liquid light. I feel a deep sense of peace here, like time itself has slowed down.

I take a step forward, my feet sinking slightly into the soft earth beneath me. The sound of the water lapping gently at the shore fills the air, and I feel drawn to it, almost as if the lake is calling me. Without thinking, I slip off my shoes and step into the water. It's cool and refreshing, the sensation sending a shiver up my spine as I wade deeper, the water rippling around my legs.

As I walk further, I notice something unusual—a large, smooth stone rising out of the lake, like a natural platform. It’s perfectly round, covered in moss and small flowers. Intrigued, I make my way toward it, the water barely reaching my knees now. The stone feels warm under my feet as I step onto it, and I sit down, gazing out across the lake. The stillness is comforting, the world around me soft and full of possibility.

Suddenly, a soft light appears on the horizon, growing brighter as it comes closer. It’s not like the sun, but something else—shimmering and ethereal, like a star falling from the sky. It hovers just above the water, casting gentle beams of light across the surface. I watch in awe, feeling no fear, only wonder. The light moves toward me, and as it does, the water beneath it begins to glow in response.

Then, something shifts—slowly, almost imperceptibly—and I realize I’m no longer alone. A figure materializes from the light, their shape ethereal, but undeniably present. They are tall, dressed in flowing robes of soft white and gold, their face glowing but unformed, as if it’s not quite meant to be seen. But I can feel their presence deeply, like they’ve always been a part of me.

The figure steps closer, and as they do, a sense of understanding washes over me. It’s not through words, but through a knowing. They reach out, their hand hovering just in front of mine. I hesitate for only a moment before I take it. The moment my fingers brush theirs, I feel a surge of warmth—a warmth that spreads through me, filling me with peace and clarity. The figure’s presence is grounding, yet freeing, and I realize that they are both guiding me and reminding me of something I’ve always known.

Without speaking, they gesture toward the glowing water, and I look down. The surface is now a canvas, a swirling tapestry of colors and patterns—images of moments from my past, my present, and even glimpses of what might be. The water shows me the path I’ve walked, and the path that lies ahead, shifting and changing with every glance.

The figure nods once, as if to say, ""You’re on the right path. Trust what you see, trust what you feel."" Then, as quietly as they came, the figure begins to fade back into the light, leaving me with the lake, the warmth, and a newfound sense of direction.

I stay on the stone, my fingers still tingling from the touch, and watch as the light dissolves into the sky. The lake, now calm and clear again, reflects the stars as night falls. I feel a deep sense of peace, as if I’ve just been given a gift I didn’t know I needed. I stand slowly, taking one last look at the serene water before I turn and walk back along the shore, feeling lighter, like something inside me has shifted into place.

She lived in a suburb over to the city that we were staying in, and she told us that her house was in the same price range as our one-bedroom house.

I was walking with my friend a small ginger kid that's a little chubby just chatting and then his dad who is a bald taller ginger guy who is also a wizard shows up and he started to teach us magic, that's when I learned I was pretty good at fire magic and my friend was good at shapeshifting magic and I remember being really jealous of them.

As night time rolls around we would start to play hide and seek and we did that for a bit until it became Halloween and monsters started showing up at night at that point, so my friend try's to shapeshift into a monster that showed up but was found out immediately and the monsters attacked him. So I'm dodging and weaving past all these monsters to get back to the camp and I am terrified so I eventually make it to the center of the camp where there's this giant conference room table with my friends dad there and I was just really confused.

The dad eventually pulls out a projector and he says he's going to show me how my life actually went down, now I am in this giant diner ordering breakfast and i just remember being really happy cause I'm about to order pancake and a shake.

Then we fast forwarded to me as a teenager taking a trip to China, I'm back with my best friend who's now taller still a little chubby and ginger and another friend who has tall and lanky, we're just bar hopping in China trying to get a little drunk. At some point were riding around on electric scooters until we found a portal in the middle leading somewhere just overall confused, while we're confused about the portal two little kids come up and try to steal our scooters.

We decided to leave and we were a little anger but we were also rushed because all of our classmates went to a bigger bar and we're rushing to get to it. As we arrive we meet a little Asian girl in a traditional Chinese dress and a lantern on a long stick saying she'll guide us to the bar as there were monsters on the path. As we're walking I remember I have fire magic and start burning the monsters to protect everyone.

I break off from the group at some point and go into this side hallway with my friend explains how there is a renowned artist that'll really like, as we approach the artist we get attacked by another monster and I burn it as I am being told that the Artist is the one who makes the monsters and they're just sculptures that I have just been destroying. Feeling incredibly guilty I buy some sculptures from the artist as an apology and then I woke up.

One was entirely chess-themed with the floors being checkered and everything taking on a dark mahogany and ivory color. I received a text from a friend who was once a lover. I tell him about my adventure. He responds with one-word responses. He then texts ""Texting you bores me. I rather just play the game"" I text back ""You wouldn't be bored if you Facetimed me"". There is no response. I remember waiting forever for that response. And it never came. I get off the elevator to the basement. There was an event I was there for, but I can't recall it. It's more of a garage with cars all over and random tires. The slightly overweight leader comes to talk to me. He was with a group of people that he sent away. He puts on a movie; the movie made me uncomfortable. Being alone with the mechanic leader made me uncomfortable. My dad walks in. I don't know where he came from.

I was walking through the hallways with white linoleum square tiles and gray walls, and walking away from the end of the hallway into the real building. I was leaving my favorite teacher’s class and saw my abusive ex boyfriend and he smiled at me. He is about 5’6” and has short brown hair with blue eyes and dimples. I was mostly in my own body (actor). He says hi to me so we both walk to an outside parking lot. I feel very weary and confused about what is happening. The parking lot has an old mustang that’s silver, and no yellow parking spaces, just cracked concrete and a bridge overpass. There’s a steep wall of dirt and some sparse grass from the edge of this parking lot to the overpass. We are standing out there and he sincerely apologizes to me for everything he did. I feel peaceful and relief even though it’s been many years since we’ve had contact. He sees his current girlfriend and waves at her, and she smiles and waves back at the both of us. She is by the main entrance to the school, roughly 100 feet away, framed by a large green field followed by an actual parking lot with cars, and a blue sky and large electric poles far in the distance. The building is tall and silver. She has a short light brown bob and blue eyes, and waves with her left hand. She is wearing a purple and orange striped turtleneck. Me and my ex boyfriend turn back to each other, and communicate that the conversation was nice, and we are both glad we could finally mature enough to have the conversation at all.

I didn't know most of the people but I did recognize a friend that I hadn't seen in a very long time. I was very happy to see her. We were making crafts with tubes, plastic string, and other objects in order to make a mini-version of a church. We were at a table, it looked like we were in a house that I had been in at some point before but I did not recognize it. At some point, we all had to get ready for church and then leave. Which is weird because I don't normally go to church and then friend I was doesn't go to the same church I do. There was this little boy that was very defiant and didn't want to get ready for church. He was very dirty and still playing with the crafts so I picked him up and took him to the bathroom and put him in the bath so that I could get him cleaned up. For some reason his head kept going under the water and no matter how many times I tried to pick him up, he would flip and go back under water. I was trying to get him clean and was worried that he was going to drown and no matter how low the water level was, it felt like he was smaller than the water level and I could not get him out. I got him out and I had to get us dressed and I remember putting on mascara with one hand which made my lashes really long, and holding him in my other hand. We made it to church and everyone was looking at us because we were late. We explained to the priest why we were late but it didn't matter and we were kicked out of the service while everyone glared at us. Then I woke up. For the most part everyone looked normal.
