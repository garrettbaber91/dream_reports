Uh, We were walking down the aisle about to say, I do and he's about like three years younger than me and everyone is all dressed up. It's a huge Halloween wedding and all of a sudden another girl walks down the aisle and she tells me that she and my fiancee slept together. completely, utterly broke my heart and I pulled out an axe  out of nowhere and I don't know if it was hidden in my dress or just magically in the stars for me to grab and I just cut her head off. and it was, it was angry, I was angry, can't you can't really blame me for that. And then I just started beating up my boyfriend after that. It was like I woke up and everything seemed normal. I don't know how, but it was just calm as can be. And, I just, I've been cheated on before. So that's probably why I raged so much, but there's nothing I could do to help it. Like there was no stop, There was no intermedian. Um and I honestly, I woke up a little bit in tears because I don't like to be that person and I would hope that my significant other would never cheat on me because I've walked down the aisle a couple of times and that's exactly what the hell's happened minus the axe part, but it's it was a little gruesome and a couple of those times will make me cry, but afterwards I remember that it's not real, It hasn't happened. And, you know, I had to stop letting the past, my past experiences creep into my current dreams with my current relations. so. "

And I remember looking up to the sky a lot, looking at the stars and then next thing you know, I turn, I turn my head to the left and we're driving and as soon as we're driving I was just like, oh, like I was like, my head, I'm so happy.

39, The dreams that I have been having have occurred from the incident that took place this past weekend which was friday leading to saturday morning and every time I go to sleep it just been repeating the same activity again. Shot at with bullets over and over again. And it's really terrifying knowing that you know all of us are standing on the porch and I got shot up. My brother got shot up four more of my other cousin got shot up in this. It's a mess. It's a real nightmare.
40," Okay, so I remember I was dancing with some young lady and uh, nobody I even knew or anything. And uh, we're I don't know what it was related to, but then uh,  it was weird because uh, my wife, I always compliment around her neck and uh  whoever I was dancing with exposed her neck, and  was flirty and I ended up kissing her neck.  and then uh I kind of woke up like because I knew that was wrong and that kind or what the heck, but it seemed real as heck, so that coming to me, so that's the end of that dream, I'll to think about it. But that was bizarre about that. It just seemed so real, like a woman was really there, you know? Um, I was trying to think about the other ones I've had. Since I've been here."
42,"So in the dream, uh I had dreamt of two guys breaking into my, my family new house and I grabbed the shotgun and when I grabbed him to shoot him, it was empty and then that was it, they killed me right there. And then I just woke up ever since then, that's all I think about."
43,"It was about some criminals I didn't know and a whole bunch of mud and they tried to like rob me like get my money, get in my house to get my money and I got scared and I started walking up walking up the mud to a safe house and then I got to the safe house. It was safe. But then when I came back out my phone was destroyed and they destroyed my phone. Yes. It is weird. Just a whole bunch of criminals."
44,"It was a regular, a regular day of hanging with family members and friends at home. Um, um, the people that I was with and around, the age range of me just doing typical daily things a normal summer day."
45,
46,
47,
48," The guy was standing over me. Shooting me, and I  woke up."
49,
50,
51," Okay. The dream was that my sick pet, um my sick pet, I remember seeing her and she was at the time she was infected with the fungus. She's an underwater animal. And I remember seeing her and she was shaking it off and I just felt sad and then the next day she died."
52,
53,
54,
55," Well, started off walking down the street. I was in like a back alley with a fence and it was these two piles of leaves that I walked up on was one small one, one big one. And it was all like, you know, raked up looking good, leaves, all different colors and everything. So I thought it was like Autumn like fall something like that. And then I still had a gun in my hand and so I was thinking like where to put it because I don't know why I had a gun in my hand so I put it in one of the small leaf pile and I walked away and then I started getting paranoid. So I came back for the gun and I felt around in a small leaf pile and I felt it again like see somebody else would have found it and then I stuffed in a bigger pile. And then as I was stuffing it in a bigger pile I turned around and somebody jumped on top of me and started attacking me. And I woke up"
56,
57,
58,
59," the setting of the dream was my boyfriend's house and it is very familiar to me and my Children. Um My three sons were there with me and we were just cleaning up, had a good day, really warm outside sunny. Um My kids are 13, 9 and six all boys. And um we got home from a really good day, swimming at the beach good summer day basically and my boyfriend showed up there at the house with his buddies but they seemed way bigger than they usually are in real life if that makes sense. And the house started changing doors were there when they aren't usually there. Um I was trying to hurry up and clean. I felt super anxious and worried that I was gonna be in trouble and um I didn't want the boys to be scared and I didn't really taste or smell anything but I could like the touch and texture I mean just cleaning cleaning stuff and like cleaning as fast as hard as I could like to  get it and that's I don't know why I would dream that kind of strange but I wanted to make sure everything was tiptop shape before he gets home and he don't care about stuff like that. Um But at some point they all just started like busting in the house and being jerks to me and you know kind of pushing me around basically and telling me and my kids to get out and leave and that's where it kind of ended and I woke up"
60,"The part that just keep coming up is me out the car, Me running. And I could just see me up under the car, trying to brace myself while the car driving to get from under the car. And I'm just screaming, Stop, stop, please I'm up under the car, stop, That's it, and I wake up."
61,
62,"alright, so in this dream I typically get probably pretty much almost like every month, it's almost like in a in a war zone battlefield. Um It would be, it's always my brother, which makes sense because he was in the services and I always want to be in the services has always been me and him and then my wife and then my other brother and his kids and we're trying to get away from like this war ship that's going on in the country or in this dream um can't really justify exactly what's going on in the dream because we're always rushing um to collect everyone and go to this hidden spot. Um The feelings I have during the dream are like anxious um When I wake up I feel like I'm almost living it, you know, I wake up like panicking um when it gets down to sensory experiences in the dream, Not really. Um It would just be mostly sound probably you know, anything like a war field or you know, something like that. Um okay I think that's it."
63," I had a dream, me and my daughter and son, was just sitting on the porch laughing and you know when you're dreaming there's no sound. But I woke up so happy, that's about it. It was just a happy dream, just laughing, looking at each other with smiles, you know, that's all it was."
64,
65,"Okay. I remember I was in like I don't know what type of area like a carnival set up here now that I'm thinking about it. It's like wait a minute. And I had to get past these grueling guards and in order to get past them, you had to go through this like barrier and I can just see red around it. And I managed to find a uh escape area to where I could sneak past another guard and get out. And then that's all I remember on that one."
66,"It was Friday morning around like four or 5:00 o'clock AM um I woke up from a dream where I seen blood, it was blood everywhere. I was in like a bathroom, but it wasn't a house bathroom, it was like a public restroom or whatever and I heard gunshots, I wasn't like it wasn't no one there, but I just heard gunshots seen blood, and everything and that's it. Okay. I know another dream. Like I had another dream like right after that a man had, it was a man standing over me and I was in bed and he had both his arms out reaching to me and a white shirt on, he had a white shirt on and it was just saying um I'm shot, I'm shot, but he was saying it. I was saying it in real life when this thing happened to me, but he was just saying it and I got real scared and I couldn't see his face, he was just walking closer and closer to me. That's it."
67," In my dream, I seen my ex girlfriend and an old friend of mine period, my girlfriend and I were dancing period. Then at some point she disappeared period. I was eating a salad, wondering where she went. That's it."
68," I had a dream once that I was walking down the street, a guy attacked me. I do not know him. And all I remember was pulling out a knife and stabbing him. I did not want to but I felt like my body was in harm's way. I never knew the man, I never knew why he came after me and after that I was afraid to go outside because I thought everybody wanted to hurt me, why I did not know. Um My brother was in a dream asking me what happened, came home with blood on my hands, I explained  what happened to him. But the whole dream was about me actually defending myself against somebody. So I woke up from that feeling very paranoid the week after that everything the week after that, huh? Oh God, let me think, a week after that. I had a dream. Me and My brother, younger brother got into a fight. I ended up busting him in his head with a stick because he bit me. Well he ended up passing away during the ordeal and I ended up going to prison For like 15 years and it traumatized me to this day because I don't I have a fear of going to jail over anything. That's why I stay to myself because I don't like to deal with guns and drugs or anything like that because I don't I fear going to jail I fear retaliation on people. I fear when I have dreams of killing people I have fears of dreams of people trying to kill me, Oh what can I say?"
69,
70,
71,
72,
73,"There was one where I was dreaming about my friends and we were like all trying to group up together, it was like an apocalypse or something. I don't know something was happening. Everything is moving too fast for me to actually understand and keep up with it. But it's like we were trying to survive from something I don't know, this would be so weird and just so random. I don't want to remember them. Um, fuck. That's the only one I can remember right now."
74, I had a dream that someone was chasing me trying to kill me. Um Someone not familiar. Um And then I woke up out of my sleep and I did not want to go back to sleep. I was scared. I have dreams like that a lot.
75," so I used to have a dream. I used to go downstairs to see who it was and I couldn't see them. So I walked in the next room and I walked in the next room. It was them. I asked him what they doing in the, in the house, they  say I ain't doing nothing, so we start tussling. I was swinging up tussling trying to fight him. That was it."
76,"last year I had somebody really close to me and um in my dream I just remember seeing this person and he just came up to me and gave me a really big hug and a long hug,  and I just didn't understand why because that was pretty much all the dream was and then I was just trying to make sense of it when I woke up from it and it didn't really make sense to me until after the car accident and that's just where it kind of just hit me and it made me feel really eerie because I was just like it was scary because it was like you know trying to make sense of it."
77,"When I go to sleep, feel my head getting tight and I could see myself passing out and then I like tried to reach for the calling thing to call the nurse but I don't have enough energy to and then when I wake up it's not real but I still feel like the pressure in my head. When I fall back asleep it just resume again. And I ended up behind the curtain like slowly falling. And then I woke back up. This how it happen."
78,"it was night and I was headed on my way home, riding normal speed limit and it was a one way road and another another way like two way across is for two cars. So this person was stopped in the middle of the road and I was going on my way down. They would just stop, they didn't have their turn signal on, I kept on going and I just see them and, I literally just remember that it just turned right when I was past them and they smacked into me and that was that's what woke me up from the dream. And it's really scary because it's literally the same thing happened to me in the real in real life where my accident was the motorcycle accident. The lady was drunk too."
79,
80,
81,"alright. Um I was knocked out for surgery and I was laying in the medical bed and I felt a presence watching me and I sat up right away. Um The environment I was in wasn't evil, it was like in between um like this physical place and in the next realm, but it was almost like this evil entity was facetiming me because in this little area like I could see him sitting there and his legs were crossed and his arms were crossed and he was just watching me because he tried to take my voice away. And, When I looked into this little zone that he was in like this little uh portal almost it's the worst feeling of despair, death, no hope, absence of God, absence of love. Um And he was frustrated that he was not gonna get what he wanted. Um I looked at him with the most confidence and with no fear and I said that you have no power here and when I said that it's like he ended, he hung up the call, he didn't say anything, he just receded and left. And that's that. Yeah, that's it."
82,
83," I had a dream. That me and my wife were together for some reason, I couldn't find her and the more I look for the weirder things got and found her in the room with her um her son's dad and they were laughing at me and it just seemed like um we weren't in a relationship no more and it was confusing to me in my dream and it angered me.  and it felt like kind of real, like it could really happen and when I woke up it just stayed on my mind like, wow is she sneaking around with this guy? Why am I thinking this way?"
84,
85,"Okay, the dream was uh,  me and my brother David running through the snow and it was when we were Children, so it was a pleasant dream."
86,"I was um,  the dream happened when I was in jail.  No, I had a dream that somehow I got out of myself and I was on top of the roof and I was looking at two other buildings, they were like kind of split apart, My mind was okay, well I gotta get off of here, so I'm gonna jump over here, onto there, onto there but uh  obviously you know, I'm not superman and I took that leap and I woke up instantly after that, like, you know when I woke up, I felt like I was like, oof, I can't believe my stupid self jumped, but I didn't, you  know, hit the ground, nothing like that."
87,"The last dream I had was of...Um Okay, but the last dream was uh what. gotta think for a second now,  I had it. Um I was dreaming of it was of my son, uh my 14 year old son. And I was dreaming that he he has had a leg injury and I in the dream he was working out and he didn't have any issues with his leg. He uh he was running and he was doing football drills and he was showing me that he could do it and saying look, watch him. And that was, and then I woke up."
88,
89," Well I was dreaming friday night. I had this dream about my one of my good friends that has passed away and want to need to buy an engagement ring from him. And my girlfriend was ex girlfriend was like sitting in front of him in another car and I was supposed to give her the ring. Why, I don't know. I was just supposed to I guess in the dream, so I'm chasing her down trying to give her the ring, give her the ring, and I could never catch her. That was pretty much it."
