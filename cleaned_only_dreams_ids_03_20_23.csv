3659S," -There was a dream I was at a non-uniform wearing military school. Perhaps it started with a welcome lecture for the school. At any rate, the man in charge announced we were all expected to take a D-Class. (There may have been a different name for it, I forget now, D-something.) I thought the D stood for Defense. However, as the teacher/headmaster talked about it I learned it stood for Divine Inspiration. Classes to bring out people's unexpressed natural talents. One example of a D-Class he provided was learning to sing like Michael Bubl√©, and he gestured to the side and there was Michael Buble. I don't sing, so I wasn't gong to take Michael Buble's class.  In the next scene that teacher/headmaster person was helping me with my D-Class activity. It was a bit similar to aerial acrobatics. There was fabric or a rope or something that I was leaning my body weight against and which the teacher, who was in the center of the room, was holding. This leaning enabled me to propel myself to slowly spin around the room - but I was airborne. The teacher had said something about ""dancing with your hands"" - to be expressive with the hands, for example, as you see in Hula dancing. So I was leaning out, with my arm outstretched -similar to God in Michaelangelo's The Creation of Adam painting- and just barely trilling my finger against... I'm not sure what it was, it was not a wall but it did encircle the space, it had a quality similar to the surface of a calm silvery lake, but it was thin and wispy and see-through, like the way some movies indicate the presence of magic. I was wearing a chiffon dress which was blowing up above my pelvis, but that was a non-issue, even though the space below was filled with men from this military school.    -The next scene had a bunch of people in a different room. It was a large room, and people were dressed up; it was some kind of costume party. When I went in with another person, I noticed there was a large fire extinguisher which was spraying fog into the air. It was next to a person dressed in a Baroque outfit, and did not look like real-life fire extinguishers. There were so many strange props and decorations and whatnot that no one in the room had noticed. The substance being emitted was toxic, like CO2, so the people were oblivious until they began to pass out. We tried to get as many people out through the door from which we came. The door that lead to the vestibule / connected to the rest of the building. At the far side of the room the windows continued down lower than the floor and there was a sunken rectangular space in front of each of these windows which were spaced evenly along this wall, which curved in an arch, instead of 3 straight walls at right angles. Anyway, the people closest to the curved wall, who were furthest from the door where we'd been telling people to evacuate, had passed out and fallen into the sunken spaces in front of these windows. It was not possible to pull them out. But then someone, it may have been me, noticed the windows were hinged at the top and opened like a flap - like a doggy door. So we went down, and through the flap window and evacuated the unconscious people along with us. Some of the rescuers were big people who couldn't fit down into the sunken space or through the flap windows, and they couldn't believe that I or anyone else could fit. They stood up on the regular floor saying unhelpful comments along the lines of ""it's not possible"" and ""it can't be done.""    -Next scene: My best friend and I are the main characters. We are fleeing.  (When I first got up I remembered how this started but now I forget.) After a certain amount of trying to get away from the people who are after us, we did something which caused a ruckus in the other side of a large building, and as ""they,"" whoever ""they"" were, entered the building in the direction of the ruckus, we exited the other side of the building unnoticed. At one point I had to check my friend's blood sugar; it was very difficult to prick her finger and get the blood on the strip - I think we were scaling a wall or climbing over something. At one point another man who noticed we were carrying some items offered my friend a maroon leather satchel. She took it, and it was much easier to carry a satchel over her shoulder than individual items in our hands, but then it occurred to me he may be on ""their"" side and the satchel could have a tracking device in it to tell ""them"" where we were. (I don't remember what we did about the satchel.) Toward the end we were fleeing down a hard ape terraced hillside that lead down to a lowland water area. People lived down there on the water. One area was for farming, another area was for parking their long tail boats -think floating markets of Thailand, but the boats were empty and no people were around. It would have been easy to take one of the boats and go in the direction where the water got wider away from the people 's point of access to the water, but the boats were brightly colored. Even at a distance ""they"" would be able to see us in a magenta or teal colored boat. The other option was the build our own. There were wide strips of Eucalytus bark which could have been used, but this would have been much more difficult.  Then there was a scene with some locals  at a ""boat stop"" - like a bus stop for long boats. (I forget what happened.)    -Next scene: We are on land in the country. There were two type of domesticated herd animals. Buffalo was one, I forget the other. ""They"" have our animals.  We are trying to save them. At one point we caught up. They had to slow down to climb over a tall split rail fence.  Something about if ""they"" knew we rescued some of our animals, ""they"" would kill the baby animals, which they still had. So we tracked them, and the wise guide with us said our only chance was to get them on the pass over the mountains. So we climbed the mountain. Somewhere high in the mountains, in a large ravene was a giant holographic bust of Jafar from Aladdin (and whatever he said must have been scary as hell because it woke me up.)",,

The shop owner is a middle aged woman comes with us for memory sake but when we get there our foreman who is friends with her tries to figure out why she is selling it and it was going to be so she could start a new life and find someone to be with. I don't hear the whole conversation because I'm looking at a very large red craftsman toolbox about 6 feet wide and 5 feet tall but our foreman and her end up together and she keeps the shop. I take my time looking around the shop to see if I can find a displate or some wall art for Audrey and while I don't find that there are some weird creations like something that looked like a racoon mixed with an iguana. As I am leaving the shop I see the guy and the girl walking off together. Something seems odd about the way they are walking but I don't think much of it beyond that and go a different direction to reflect on my life. For some reason I decide I need to go back to the shop and while I'm walking back I get to a T shaped road in like a city residential area and I am on the left side of the base of the T and that same guy and girl are walking across the middle of the top of the T to the far right side, maybe 70 feet away. Its at this moment I realize that he has her at gun point. The guys sees me and realizes I know. I'm too far to close the gap so I turn to run, but as I turn i get shot in the spine about 8 inches from the base and everything starts to fade.

I remember I saw him at the bank as like a manager or something and Ryan asked me to speculate how much he was making there.

Dreamlet I remembered before I quite realized I had yet fallen asleep: kneeling next to a pond, a fish in the water that was connected with me somehow, doing a task for me. A creature surfaced at the edge of the water so I thought it was the fish, but when I patted its head, the shape was wrong, and I realized it was a dolphin. I affectionately stroked its sleek head before it dived back under.     In another scene, I was in a vast white exhibition space. An elevated glass vitrine enclosed a tiny piece of paper, about the size of a small postage stamp. As I magnified it, I could see the text written in Courier or another old typewriter font. It was blurry from magnification, but I could just barely make it out well enough to read. It was a page from the contract of a man who had wanted to make education free and fun. But of course by now corporations had corrupted his idea, making a sleek and monetized version of his original aspiration.    ",,
27066S,"""Across the borders, the bogs burn bright. You don't say that at Westminster.""     I had been making a field recording, and this sounded like a suitable place to close.    There were horses in a pasture, and a woman had been talking about riding and raising her daughter. She, her daughter, and her husband all rode, ""because horses are the best thing in life."" And she commented how natural her husband looked on the back of his. For some reason, I could see the handles of scissors sticking up from the withers of some of the horses.     There was also a written text: before it turned into the monologue I was recording, I had been reading the text, perhaps aloud. Although it was written as prose, it had a wonderful meter, and I was tempted to excerpt and quote it in the form of blank verse and send it in a letter.     I had been drawn to this area, before it changed into the scene from the book, by a rhythmic sound, subtle, the chanting of insects, but more percussive than usual, almost staccato, so I got my phone out and started recording as I walked forward slowly. I was on top of the mountain in a sparse pine wood.     Just before this, I had yielded to temptation and taken off my socks. There was the risk of stepping on something sharp or dirty, but socks were only partial protection, and I really wanted to the texture of the fresh ground on my feet, the crisp crinkle and rough but yielding padding of pine needles underfoot.     I was on top of a mountain so steep I could barely see down below except through thinner patches in the mist. It was not cold and windy on this summit, though, but a patchy pine forest. I had to be careful where I put my feet, because if I lost my balance and slipped down the slope, I didn't know how I would make my way back up, so steep was it.     I wanted to tell my husband about this place, and was reminded of another steep mountain we had visited once. Where as that? My mind considered various European countries, but I'm pretty sure the memory itself came from another long ago dream.   ",,

The error in the thought (""collamorative"" for ""collaborative"") woke me up a little more, made me realize that although I had been under the impression that I was lying awake in bed piecing together my last dream, I had in fact slipped back under the threshold of sleep and started dreaming anew.  The thought itself was either about a dream or a scholarly paper or (what feels most accurate) a dreamed hybrid of the two. There had even been a immersive scene in the renewed dream-state: I living in a place with a long L-shaped driveway that reminded me of where I lived as a teenager. Having to trudge the quarter-mile to the mailbox seemed tedious, yet it filled me with a strong feeling of nostalgia to find myself doing this again. My mind was half-awake enough to immediately begin analyzing the sensation and the situation that had aroused it. I looked around the environment, wondering what specifically I was nostalgic for. I wasn't sure, but I suspected it was connected with the natural world, to a longing to be back in the countryside... in a place where it would be pleasant to take a walk, even an obligatory one to get the mail.      Earlier, the dream I had been attempting to remember: I was watching a movie with my husband, planning to make dinner after it was done, but he expressed that he was hungry now. I remembered that there was a turkey leg in the freezer, so I offered to heat it up for him as a snack. [Day Residue: Yesterday tried to take stock of all the food in the freezer, and make plans to start using it up to make space again.] As I opened the freezer and sorted through the contents, I was surprised to discover that some things were frozen solid, as they should be, but other things were oddly malleable, as if they hadn't frozen right. I thought I use use those up first.     I pulled out what I had thought was the turkey leg, but it turned out to be half a chicken, previously roasted. Nevermind, this would work just as well. I heard the sounds of the movie still playing upstairs, and was annoyed that I was missing it, so I called up: ""Could you pause it, please?"" [Distortion: Though in many respects the dream accurately modeled our apartment, we had been watching the movie upstairs, which is not possible in WL.]     I opened the bag containing the chicken and dumped the considerable quantity of juice into the sink. I immediately regretted it: those had been the cooking juices, and I could have used them as the basis for a flavorful sauce. Oh well, too late now, I would have to make do without it.   ",,

My bags had just been scanned and cleared and I was trying to get my scattered stuff back together when a new press of people crowded in and made me realize that we were all dangerously close together, and no one was wearing a mask. The security agent who had been helping me, an amiable older man, said nothing but smiled patronizingly in a way that made me wonder if he thought I was being unnecessarily anxious. ""Is that not a thing in here?"" I asked him. ""Like when you cross into international waters, the rules no longer apply?"" He nodded again, vaguely. I wasn't really reassured, and wondered if I should put on a mask. But if I was the only one wearing one, wouldn't that make everything think that *I* was sick? And maybe it was too late anyway. I had been in this room breathing the air with everyone for a while now.     [Day Residue: Last night while browsing news before bed I came across an article with photographs contrasting the US and Chinese airports during mid-March: https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/long-reads/article/3082162/why-american-mother-rushed-her-daughters-back]    I saw someone I knew from college at the line across the room. ""Hey, Ian!"" I called out to him. ""Where are you going?"" He said something vague about going to see friends and family. ""You mean in Virginia?"" I asked, and he nodded. I immediately wondered how I knew he had family in Virginia, because I can't remember ever having known that. I was on my way to Hong Kong but hesitated to mention it, lest it sound like one-upmanship.     [DR: Haven't seen this guy in person in over 20 years, but often see his Facebook posts, and recently he posted a photo of his impressive ""pandemic beard."" On Friday, was PMing a colleague during a Zoom meeting and he mentioned family in Virginia.]     Buses were pulling up outside, and my heart sank when I realized I would need to take a shuttlebus to the gate, the least efficient airport process ever, and one that would involve sharing air with another close-packed group of strangers. My mother (the vague impression of who I was traveling with apparently transformed from my husband to my mother in the course of the dream) had already gotten on board the first one. But by the time I managed to get all my items from the security belt organized and in a state where I could carry them, the first three buses had filled up, so I had to get on the last one. At least it wasn't very crowded yet. I was a little alarmed because I didn't remember which gate I was flying out of, but I knew I had my ticket in my bag, so as soon as I sat down I could check it.     Earlier sleep period:    ""Sorry... it's hard to relax when I can feel the industrious ants move their larva all along my body!""     I had been embracing a Buddhist monk, both of us bare-chested, but the crawling sensation of the ants moving between us was becoming a distraction. Where were the ants taking their larva? I hoped they weren't trying to stash them in some bodily crevice. I felt distant curiosity and faint annoyance at the tickling physical sensations, but no real anxiety about the situation.     [Bleedthrough: I suspect the physical sensations were bleedthrough from being a bit hot and prickly in the sheets.]      I could tell that the monk would have preferred that we keep embracing, but he quietly accepted my reluctance without complaint. He pulled out a packet of wet wipes and began gently cleaning my face. It was a sweet gesture, and I anticipated that we might continue in this vein and mutually clean the ants off one another's torsos. I liked the idea, but the tedious environmentalist in me objected that we would go through an awful lot of wet wipes in the process. Maybe I should just invite him to take a bath.     We were in a vague room-like space, neither private nor public (my dream spaces often feel both hybrid and unspecified) that several minutes ago had been a kind of elevated city street, a car-free overpass. A large machine had been situated up here by an artist, who invited the public to interact with his machine. We could either give it an object we were carrying, or pour water over it. The machine had a function that in some way emphasized the weight and materiality of the objects and substances among which we lived.     [Day residue: Last night investigated the availability for loan or purchase of Lucy Lippard's Six Years: The Dematerialization of the Art Object from 1966 to 1972.]     As I approached the machine, a man in a bright orange shirt the color of a Thai monk's robes walked by, brushing against me. I instinctively recoiled, and wondered why I was the only one reacting: both the man and the crowded appeared indifferent to the fact that a monk had just touched a woman. But despite the color, it was a shirt that he was wearing, not robes, so maybe he wasn't actually a monk.     Then I noticed that I was carrying about eight small umbrellas (the fabric only about one foot in radius). Half were the bright orange of Thai Theravada robes, and half the deep crimson of Tibetan Mahayana robes. I was giving away the umbrellas to anyone who wanted one. I came across a man wearing the robes of a Tibetan monk who took an orange one, and I said, wait, maybe you want a red one? But I tried to ask in Thai, and when he appeared confused, I wasn't sure if it was because he didn't understand Thai or because I misspoke. I realized I might have mistakenly used khiao, which means green, instead of the word for red, and tried to correct myself, but now all I could remember was the Chinese word for ""a red one,"" hong se de.     I got myself out of this linguistic mess by just showing the monk the red umbrella, its color matching that of his robes, and he exchanged the orange one for it. ""Phra thook,"" I wanted to say in Thai, meaning ""a correct monk,"" but not quite sure if my intended meaning would come across, or if he even spoke Thai, so I kept silent. He didn't look Thai. He actually looked like a sturdily built but not unattractive young Mongolian man.     [Day residue: The monk resembled the lead singer from The Hu, a mongolian band that I was reminded of the other day while trying to close some of dozens Firefox tabs I had left open in my browser, and saw this video I had watched a couple month ago: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJZfEh3EciU]     Our interaction around the umbrellas had turned into a kind of flirtation, and soon we were embracing, skin to skin (not a correct monk after all!) I had observed that Tibetan monks were much more casual than the Thais in their interactions with women, but this seemed like taking things a little far even for their relaxed interpretation of the Vinaya. The ants were apparently living symbiotically on his body, and were visible walking in lines across his torso. It didn't bother me until our skin-to-skin contact meant that the ants started marching across me as well, and then it was only a problem because of how much it tickled.   ",,
8654L,"""Oh, this is my favorite part! I had forgotten about the Junk People!""    ""The Field Folk,"" replied my husband knowingly, demonstrating that he knew their fae origin.     We were watching a show, and the imminent appearance of the Junk People was being introduced by their theme song. The lyrics included a refrain with the rhyme: ""From field and rise / To gear and vise."" The Junk People were formerly field sprites, but they had modernized along with the times. I felt a happy kinship with them because I, too, have a ton of junk that I cherish because it usually allows me to find just the tool or material I need for every situation.     I glanced back at the notes I was writing in my dream journal and realized, damn it, this had been a false awakening. Then I woke up properly had had to record the dream all over again.     In the earlier dream I had been in a barn watching two horses. They were cartoon-like in appearance, very simplistic, but there seemed something authentically horse-like in their interactions as one nibbled affectionally at the other's withers. I was taking reference pictures on my phone, in case I wanted to paint this someday. Then one of the horses approached me and became more lifelike. I stroked its head, admiring its gentle and amiable spirit, and apologized that I had nothing more concrete to offer to express my thanks.     I had to go, but a third horse, a young filly, came along with me, in the human form of a teenage girl. We tiptoed through a farmhouse, trying to exit without being seen. We heard someone in the kitchen chopping carrots - I realized that it was possible to identify the vegetable by the sound the knife made passing through it. As we were sneaking by the entrance to the kitchen, we didn't see anyone inside. ""Oh! Steal a carrot!"" I suggested, thinking it would make a nice treat for my friend, since she was really a horse. But then a few members of the family came into the room, forcing us to try to act nonchalant. They didn't react to our presence, making me surmise that the kids in this family must have a lot of friends over, such that they took the presence of two random teenage girls for granted. Would the mother of the family be annoyed if she knew we we had been stealing carrots? Or would she be delighted to see young people who *wanted* to eat healthy vegetables? We hastened out of the house and snuck across the road.     Later I was in a 7-11. I was traveling, and had stopped in for a bottle of water and a snack. I spent a long time perusing the shelves, trying to decide what drink to buy, and not finding anything suitable. People were crowded in the aisles, and all at one I realized that no one was wearing a mask. I wasn't either! How could I have forgotten? I didn't even have one on my, but luckily I was wearing a grey turtleneck, so I pulled the loose fabric at the neck up over the lower half of my face. I had to keep my hand up to hold it in place, and thus in order to keep my purse in place I had to put it under my shirt and clutch it firmly with the rest of the arm that was holding the fabric over my face. Most of the other patrons were black, and I was afraid they would think I was being racist, since my demeanor suggested I was being overprotective of my purse.     Unexpectedly I ran into my mom and brother in the store. It turned out they were actually staying here (apparently this 7-11 also doubled as a hotel), so I went to their room. In the ensuing conversation, my mother accused me of being antisocial. I was irritated by this and made a sharp retort, but then recollected myself and attempted to defend myself in more measured tones.   ",,

19676S,"""The mosquitoes are coming!"" There were so many that they darkened the air, and people started shouting in alarm. We were in a vast enclosed interior, one of those huge warehouse stores.     ""I have some spray, if you want to borrow it,"" I offered to the people nearby. I had noticed the mosquitoes a while earlier and prepared. Up close, I could see their banded legs. ""Aedilus aegyptus,"" I surmised. (Not bad for a non-scientist in a dream, but Google informs me that the correct scientific name is ""Aedes aegypti."")    The mosquitoes were so thick now that we had no choice but to leave the building and seek refuge elsewhere. I found myself at the train station with a female coworker who was heading back home. (I guess we both worked at the store?) We hadn't really talked about it, but it seemed like there was an unspoken understanding that I was going home with her.     I hoped she would let me stay overnight, since I had just moved to town today and didn't have a place to stay yet. I thought about bringing it up, but it seemed awkward, so I figured I would just play it by ear. If she invited me to stay the night, fine. If not, perhaps there would be an open apartment in her building I could rent, or if worse came to worse I could find a hotel in the area. The situation was complicated but also made more interesting by the fact that I found myself attracted to her.     Earlier in the dream I identified as my waking self, perhaps because I was tapping into my own memories of using mosquito spray recently and having looked up that kind of mosquito, but by the end as I was contemplating my feelings toward the coworker (who had no resemblance to anyone in WL) I no longer felt any connection with waking life.

We were told to clean out our lockers because they were being replaced.  2. I was in a unknown city. I was single and trying to get to my apartment. I went by subway. I got off walked into a parking garage and went up a ladder to 3 diving boards. I started down but had to clean off cafeteria trays because the diving boards were being removed. When I got to the bottom I put my trays I had collected in a dumpster. While there I met a young British woman who was doing the same thing. She said something to me about stacking the trays neatly. I said I could and I felt I was trying to flirt with her.,,

4853L,"1. I was swinging on a swing in my yard as a child, maybe 6 years old. Sometimes the house & yard we're familiar, sometimes not. Alone.  2. Took place in the present time. I was goofing off with some girlfriends, taking silly pictures. I had something in my right hand (multi-layered, otherwise indistinguishable). Just as I opened my hand to show my friends, sparks started shooting off the top & I realized it was a timed explosive device. I ran to the sink to drop it in, but it was stuck to my hand like with super glue. I turned on the water in a panic, but could not extinguish the sparks. Then I woke up. Quite bizarre!",,

They're closed, but they let us in any way.  3.  I'm at a stunning tropical location taking photos with my phone from my room. I can't believe how blue the water is. It shouldn't be so clear near SF. I only drove two hours from home and had no idea the spot was here. Thinking I can't wait to come back.  4. I'm volunteering at a retail store in a mall that is still under construction. They need help with workers during the pandemic, and my job at Google is slow. They say I need to stay until 6:30 and I laugh, telling him that I don't even work that late at my real job and don't plan to here. There are lots of pastries and candies for us to eat.

Went to a hotel , unfamiliar place, with daughter, daughter-in law and 2 children. There was no bed for me. Went to desk to inquire. They accused us of breaking something.

21737L,"1. Mash-up between first generation Chinese communist revolutionaries (i.e., Ai Qing) and Ableton Live. I was using Operator to order and alter sounds connected with the revolutionaries. A learning dream: was reading an article about Ai Weiwei (b.1957) last night that pointed out that he is one of the ""princelings,"" the children of the first-generation revolutionaries, along with Xi Jinping (b.1953). I also looked at the next assignment for Music clsas, and it involves using Operator in Ableton. Presently I don't have the faintest idea how to use Operator, so the dream used Simpler (which we just learned) as a model: I was manually placing notes in a MIDI chart and altering envelopes.     There was additional complexity to the plot, something about a human head buried somewhere in an expansive lawn that we were trying to locate, and other objects on the ground, possibly inspired by Valheim, which I played last night.     2. I'm in a forest at night. It is very hard to see, and I know I might blunder into enemies, so I'm trying to get to a safe place. A disembodied male voice is in contact with me, though I don't have an impression of its identity. I see a shape ahead and the voice tells me that it is the mosnter I have been trying to avoid. I try to sneak around, but the voice becomes urgent and says, ""Attack! Attack!"" I can't tell if it is a warning or a command, but I feel a surge of alarm and suddenly feel myself being pulled up into wakefulness, which is its own kind of annoyance. I wonder if I was having a sleep apnea, because as I woke I felt like I had been holding my breath. The imagery is easy enough to source: in Valheim last night, I wounded a deer and then chased it through the wilderness until I was in an area I had not explored before. By the time I finished it off, night had fallen, and it was unusually foggy, so I could barely see anything around me as I struggled up a steep embankment in the direction of home, wondering if I was going to blunder into monsters. If it weren't for the minimap, I doubt I would have been able to find my way back.     3. City under siege. The defending officer has a system: he attaches small paper notes to large grey bricks with rubber bands and throws them randomly. One brick comes through a window into the tidy second-storey apartment of three people, two guys and a girl. They are used to this. The girl grabs the brick and carries it to the large dining table, where the boys sit on either end. They also have a system. The girl takes the note from the brick and adds it to a large album. The boy on the right fetches a small square cardboard box that contains their own stack of paper notes. He rubberbands his own note to the brick, and then the second boy throws it back out the window into the city. This dream had a film-like disembodied perspective, ""I"" was not a character at all. The setting was likely sourced from Wandavision, though it was over a week ago that I saw the episode that showed Wanda's childhood apartment in the wartorn city.   ",,
1124L,1. Multiple coronavirus related dreams (I had shortness of breath falling asleep last night and the dreams were kind of panicked continuations of my worries as I fell asleep)  2. A dream about my childhood camping ground in Byron bay with my family   3. A crazy dream about a huge house and there was multiple people inside the house and we were kind of playing a game where we were supposed to murder this one person... who wanted to die. At the end his throat was slit and he changed his mind and we called an ambulance :-/  4. A dream about Singapore... but the actual location was not Singapore... (I have just returned from there) ,,
6665S,"1. My husband was making tea, in a giant glass bowl.    2. I was looking from above on a yellow tent, along a shore. My view was like looking through a spyglass; a clear circle with the tent and pitch black all around. Someone had a vacation planned to stay 8n that tent. People kept telling gim the beaches were closed but he insisted on going. He couldnt leave the circle that was surroundrd by blackness no matter how hard he tried and he coulsnt enter the tent.    3. A recurring dream I have been having is on a stray, skinny horse in a wal-mart parking lot. I pet the horse and try to give it some food everytime I am there, but cant do anything more for it. This time there were several people feeding it. I helped a couple load the horse into a trailer by luring him with apples. The couple planned to keep him if they cant fins his owner.",,
4153L,"1. My parents and I were dropping off a childhood friend after coming back from the airport (in the dream I was about 13 years old). Her driveway was flooded. While she got out of the car and my parents carried her suitcases inside I had to stay outside and swim and push the car in a continual circle so it wouldn't float away. Somehow we were all in the house. My friends parents were yelling at her in the other room about not calling when she landed. Meanwhile my parents were in the kitchen of my friends house trying to fix things: mon was watering the flowers, dad was trying to remove decal stickers from a tile wall with a scraper. I was trying to hurry them along because I saw that 5 of the Ninja Turtles were standing outside the front window and I was scared. It flashed to a woman wearing a big white fur coat and hat. She said ""what do you think of this?!"" And pushed down a giant lever. It became pitch black in the house.  I woke up and my boyfriend said I made an audible whimper (I thought I screamed in real life)   Dream 2: I was at my uncle's house and an older man asked if someone could help him get set up in the bathroom (he appeared to have some physical handicaps but was still able to walk, though slowly)  I had to carry many large heavy pillows, a karate type helmet, and blankets into the bathroom. I was trying to get these set up but was confused about the cleanliness and logistics of this when the man said, ""never mind, Mary can help"" and another older woman appeared in the bathroom to continue the process. When I left the bathroom my uncle thanked me for helping the old man and the others in the room were saying that Mary shouldn't be helping the man ""in that way"" because she was married (implying that she was having an affair with the man who was in the bathroom) ",,
27275S,"1. My sister and I surrounded by a low light tan colored ancient earth wall. We discussed how long it had been there.  2. I was worried about my friend parking in a dark alley. She was not concerned. Said she'd call me when she got home.  3.  My elder daughter , when much younger,  had asked me to babysit while on vacation. I complained that I'd been with the kids too much lately. Was cross with her for staying out so late.",,
8535L,"1. On a city sidewalk, maybe a seaport or semi industrial area, high chain link fence along the sidewalk. There is a young girl, maybe Asian, dark straight hair, maybe 7 years old,  with her mother, a slender, petite woman. The girl holds out a small plastic purse. There's a small camera and they indicate they'd like me to take their picture. Which I do. I don't think they speak English but understand they are trying to get photos of the places they've been. I am then driving the little girl some place that I think will make a more memorable photo. The girl is in the passenger seat. I'm not sure of the streets but manage to end up back where we started. I am glad that it worked out so well.  2. Very vague recollection that there are people with covid19 but that they have huge viols or tumors on their faces or bodies.    Self- analysis:   1. For my entire life (73 years) I've had car dreams with the understanding via didactic therapy, that for me, a car always represents my life. It's always negative if I'm not driving but in this case I am in control, and I get myself back to my destination. Given that Trump is trying to blame China and I reject his thinking, my guess is that the Asian child signifies my trust for Asians in general. They are ""in the picture"" but in a positive way. We have Asian friends and this was a topic of discussion yesterday.  2. I had multiple discussions yesterday about asymptomatic carriers of covid19 and having no way to identify them. With past diseases like smallpox, measles or polio, it was obvious. ",,

2253S,"1. Someone asked me to come over and help get snacks ready for a party she had arranged. When I arrived there was a lot to do and got to work. She promptly said she was going next door to tell someone something. When she didn't return immediately I went over and she was casually telling a story to this guy. I was very irritated and told her so, asked what time she told  people  to come. She said  8 and it was 10 till. I felt very irritated.  2. Something about sitting in the driver's seat of my husband's truck and wanted a friend to see if I looked like a belonged in a truck. We were laughing.  3. At the research station again and lots of people seemingly waiting for something. There was a cafe and I wanted a coke but forgot to bring money so had to go back to my room to get it. Eating at a table and noticed my meal had dripped onto my white pants. At first embarrassed but then just wondering if it would come out. A fellow researcher said they were going to try something for the communal Sunday meal but he didn't think it would work.  I said, taco salad? He was flabbergasted that I knew. I told him he unknowingly nudged his computer mouse and it revealed a list of key words including taco salad.",,
11976S,"1. Very weird. I dreamed that a beef steak was surgically removed from my leg & cooked. I was awake through the surgery, but not really alarmed about it & felt no pain. It seemed perfectly normal.  2. I dreamed that I told my daughter something she did not know about her husband, but don't now recall what that thing was. I was very surprised & sad that she did not already know that, and immediately regretted telling her, worried about the ramifications.",,
27429S,"1. Was at a casino looking for something. Nobody was wearing masks. I kept trying to cover my face with my hand/arm, and was convinced I was going to get exposed to COVID.   2. Husband and I went to family house in the Virgin Islands for vacation. For some reason, his two brothers also came and took the ""good"" bedrooms so we were stuck having to sleep in an inflatable hot tub in the living room. I was annoyed.",,
26035S,"1. Was in an unfamiliar apt. near beach. Daughter and my late mother left to walk at night. They were looking for missing friend.  2.  Was in a restaurant with no one seated around us. They were closing at 8 so we had to rush. The food very good. Friend and I split the bill, But then she suddenly added a dessert which I didn't want so didn't want to split it. One of my 2 daughters comes in and drops her blue credit card on the blue floor, We leave.",,
21796L,1. Was in Atlantic City with a Nicole a woman I used to work with. We were on the boardwalk and went in to a Casino to dine. For some reason she was wearing a orthopedic boot on one foot.  2. I was working as a staff nurse. A patient's son came in and asked how his mother was. I said I didn't know. Let's go see together. We went to see her. She was in the 2nd bed. The patient in the 1st bed was being bathed. There were the sheets from his bed on the floor as they had been change. My patient was in a chair next to the bed. I went to put on exam gloves and clean sheets for her bed. I came back and started to make her bed. The aide asked me why I was doing that because it was her job. I said I liked doing it.,,
15450S,"1. Was trying to help someone set up a funeral or memorial service. There were problems and I was arguing with the funeral home or someone in charge about what needed to happen, (lost the details) But I was annoyed.  2. I was picking up my car after having regular maintenance done. The bill was shocking. They had done a lot more work than I expected, including changing the brake pads and putting on new windshield wipers. The bill was quite detailed. I had coupons that saved me a lot f $. The bill was close to $600. The cashier said they wouldn't honor the coupons because I'd be saving too much $. The sales person came over and said she would talk to management for me. I was both hopeful and annoyed.",,
12236S,"1. We were with a couple that are our best friends. Usually do things together weekly.  We met at up at someplace that might have been near the ocean. We all had stayed overnight. We passed by Larry who was sitting in a restaurant connected to the place. He was eating a plate of waffles, something they were famous for. Nancy wasn't with him. I'm thinking he is very overweight, this is probably his 2nd breakfast and Nancy wouldn't approve. Later on we are all together, maybe in their room, not ours. We are talking about what we want for dinner. We have been here before. I say I am going to order my usual because it comes with hush puppies, not something one can get anywhere else in the area. Then, I am in the bathroom where all the fixtures appear to be original to the hotel. The door is open. Lots of dark, vibrant green trim and fixtures. Everything looks antique. There is a trash can with a dark green, flat lid, right next to the toilet which has the same kind of dark green painted seat plus another similar container on the other side of the toilet. All are the same height and quite low, maybe a little over 2 feet tall. All have dark green lids. I joke that it's hard to tell which one is the toilet.  In another part, we see them seated at a table, eating with a group of people. We are late sleepers, they are early birds. I am concerned that they didn't wait for us, but we don't stop in, just walk on by.  2. Same town/village and I am in a woodworking/antiques place/gift shop. A man comes in with his middle school age daughter. They are bringing in an antique rocking horse she has grown to tall for and the propri√©t√© is swapping hers for a taller, natural wood one that he has restored. Quite elegant looking. Beautifully carved. Beautiful wood grain and finish. The one she gives him in the swap is squat and carved and painted bright yellow with some green, and a red/orange beak, to look like a duck. I find it curious that this girl would still use a hobby horse. I find the place fascinating.  Self-analysis:  1. We often go to museums and old towns along the coast with these friends. They are taking covid19 much less seriously and have not quarantined like we have. They are constantly out and about and we feel we can't trust them now, as they could be asymptomatic carriers. She asked to get together 2 days ago. Outdoors and wearing masks. I've spent time yesterday reading about the efficacy of cloth masks and the data is confusing. It seems they aren't very protective. I struggled with my response to her, after talking at length with my spouse about it. He may have had something like Covid19 last November. He was quite ill for 6 weeks. I sent her a message yesterday saying, that because of my husband's 5 bouts of pneumonia in recent years, we just can't risk breaking this self quarantine. Since they need to be out and about, I have justifiable concerns about losing them as friends. But, that may be the case. It will be sad, but understandable, and I am aware that they think we are being foolish. I was working thru my response and possible consequences in this dream, I believe.  2. We have a lot of antiques, handed down thru our families. We are updating our wills right now and there is a memorandum section  where we can designate items. Our son had a small rocking horse similar to what the girl was trading in, although his wasn't a duck. And not something we kept. We've had major furniture pieces restored and there are some that now need fixing. A good restorer would be a good person to find.  I believe this dream is related to our current process of putting our affairs in order, deciding who gets what. However, the emotion attached to this dream was not sad. More excited and curious about finding new things, like the woodworker, and people who valued the past and history.",,
6120S,"1.) A dark figure in a dark world guided me away from other dark figures who had weapons. As more of the dark figures with weapons approached, the guide instructed them to shoot their guns to the sky. They did so without their own volition and were angry.    2.) I'm at a swim meet getting ready to compete. My dad is there and he gets my swim cap out of my bag. It's destroyed. I know he didn't do it, but I'm upset. I guess I'll have to race without it. I come to realize I don't have googles either. I can't win this way. I walk out to the pool and suddenly realize I'm dreaming. Lucid, I decide to joyfully just jump into the pool and swim around. ",,
7286S,"1.) Climbing up a door tunnel with piles of silver ""papers"" spilling out like water. A shoe box flows out, I can't get through the door. I grab the show box and open it. It's fill with tiny Barbie-like clear heels. Inside the heels are tiny black rifles. A gang comes out to get the tiny heels and the guns become life size. They're going to shoot up the building. I hug and kiss one of the gang members because I suspect he's never had a girlfriend and wants someone to love him. He has red hair. The good guys in the building jump into bomb-safe zones. They're going to blow-up the whole place to get rid of the bad guys. There's an explosion. The good guys come out. Some of them are giant teddy bears. One of the bad guys who is now a teddy bear had his head blown off, but is still alive. He joins up with the good guy teddy bear and they hold hands escaping the danger.    2.) At an office HQ having coming back from a scouting mission of some kind. A boss asked me what happened at the tennis courts. He knows I was there, but I also wasn't supposed to be there. I shrug him off and say that I don't know what he's talking about. The scene is now in a locker room. I pass by Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth. They're working on something. I make flirty eye contact with Liam. I keep going through what now appears to be the ""precinct"" - we seem to be cops. I catch up with two other cops giving me a run down of a case. We climb on file cabinets as they say that I am the most qualified for this next job because I've seen the movie Parasite 9 times. One of the cops is impressed and glad to have me on board. He points out a giant photo album like book and tells me that those are the records of his Dad's long-term affairs. He seems apathetic about that.    3.) It's before dawn and I keep sleep. I am in a house with lots of other women, perhaps we are all roommates. I sit down at the kitchen table in the dark and rest my head to try and sleep. A guy comes into the room. I get the vibe that it's Greg (who has passed). We seem to talk for a moment and I am happy he's there. I don't understand that he's already dead in the dream. The sun begins to rise and the other girls come down and about. I don't want them to be there because it's too early. I don't want them to be awake and I don't want to talk to them. I want to go back to sleep but seem to get caught up in their drama and unable to go back to my room.    4.) I'm outside on a picnic table that seems to be adjacent to what I understand to be my old high school but doesn't look like it. My friend Sarah from high school is there. She's pregnant and is talking to Emily from my work about wanting an opportunity to direct the high school musical. Emily just had a baby (this is true in real life) and she thinks Sarah would be great but wonders if it would be difficult since she would have to leave for maternity during the process. I watch as they negotiate how it might be handled. The scene shifts and we are all now inside the theatre. It's late at night and a student is trying to shut down for the night. She politely asks us to leave so she can hit the lights and go home.    5.) I'm in a back office of a school it seems. There's a wooden door with an opaque glass window along a hallway. There's also a small squash room. I seem to understand this is a dream and test it by trying to put my hand through the wall. It doesn't work. I grab what seems to a pipe and push that through the wall. It easily passes through the surfaces confirming that I'm in a dream. I use the pipe against a bunch of surfaces and am delighted that they all pass through. I get a hold of some keys and throw it against the wall, expecting it to also pass through - but it bounces off and falls to the ground. I laugh about it. I go see what's happening in the squash room and a man sees me and comes rushing out. He asks me why I would interrupt his game. We stand intimately against the wall and I wake up.    6.) I'm with my old work friends Trey and Mattie and we're driving along a road by my high school at night. As we drive along the winding road, the scene becomes day and I am so surprised to see a stunning lake surrounded by trees with autumn colors. I think to myself that I can't believe this was here during my high schools years and I never spent any time here. I think that if I had really known this was here, I would have been here all the time. I think it was a bit of a waste for me to have skipped out on this much beautiful nature. We continue to drive and cross under buildings of the school above us and I think that time has changed this place a lot. ",,
3874L,"1.) I sign up to sing at a talent show, but I don't actually want to do it. When I get there, the participation list is so high, I decide that they won't miss me so I bail on the event with a friend. I drive off in my monster rally car, rebelling and showing off my driving skills. I go off road and onto some railroad tracks (now another POV). My driving disrupts the small railroad cars and they begin to crash. They're carrying toxins and the pile up causes a massive reaction. A huge bright light over takes the scene and I understand to have died. I wake up.      2.) I'm at a hotel with friends I haven't seen in a while, we're supposed to meet up in the lobby. I get off on the wrong floor - the seventh floor. Once down there a friend's dad is there, who I am supposed to be meeting, but my friend is not there. I want to go for a quick swim so I tell them that I will meet up with them again later. I'm happy to see them again after so long.      3.) I'm at an airport/mall with my mom. I need to use the bathroom and get lost along the way. I find a bathroom that is also a someone's home and I'm not supposed to be there. A woman tells me I need to leave. Once back outside, I wander through the halls, which become more like a mall. I stop by a restaurant  where a woman is telling a co-worker about planting a purple potato tree in his yard. He refuses. She knows he likes a woman named Caroline. The woman trades Caroline's love in exchange for planting the tree in his yard. She shows up to his door with Caroline and shows him that she's already planted the tree, but she can be with Caroline if he agrees to let her keep the tree there. He asks if he's just supposed to marry Caroline now? The woman doesn't care. The guy ushers Caroline inside accepting the deal. We drive away and I eat some unfinished dinner rolls that were in a to-go container.  ",,
2708L,"1.) I'm at a family gathering and a friend wants me to buy their modern house. I love it, but it's too far away from any city. Family friends offer me a ride home. The driver is erratic and I'm worried he'll crash. Eventually, we do crash into the ocean. I see a whale in the sky and know it's a dream. Lucid, I grab the whale from the sky and bring it into the water. The whale is grateful and allows me to survive. The others don't make it. I wonder what to do next with my lucidity and it fades.    2.) I'm a merchant in an old market. I seem to be hoarding bread. I hear a voice-over talking about how I was a cook in a past life. I think that's strange considering how little I cook now. ",,
3196S,"1.) I'm at a party at a mall with a casino that we're not supposed to go into. I see an old friend (who has since died, but I don't know this in the dream) going to the Casino and I follow him. We're kicked and get in a car to go home. I show several friends in the car my scrapbook from when I was a kid. I'm impressed with my creative skills as I made a beautifully illustrated animated scrapbook. I don't remember doing it back then.    2.) I'm being lazy, lying on a sofa feeling myself getting bigger from being in quarantine for so long. My friend Linzi is there and she's pregnant (as in real life). She notices that I'm gaining weight and tells me that it's not shelter in place, it's that I'm pregnant. She wants our kids to play. I'm annoyed because I absolutely do not want to be pregnant. I remember that I have my period and feel relieved.    3.) I'm a caretaker of a beautiful home, exploring different rooms and seeing a downstairs garden I've never been too. Before I make it there, a woman that I work with comes in the house with her parents. I tell her she has to tell me before she plans on bringing guests so I can ensure the house is able to take on new people. She understands and apologizes. I let them stay.    4.) I'm in a hazy dark room when I realize I might be dreaming. To test this, I decide to walk through a wall. At first it doesn't work an when I try again it does. I'm lucid and looking for an old friend. I go down a boat staircase but every level of the stair case was a little boutique shop that kept getting smaller as I go down. People keep telling me that my friend is here, but at the bottom store. When I finally get there, it was just an old woman.    5.) I'm in the attic of a home, hiding away from other people who are also there, so I can write down my dreams. I put my pile of papers neatly in a row on the concrete floor. I understand that it has been raining for days. The water starts streaming on the floor, getting my papers wet. I hastily pick them up and unplug electrical devices nearby. I run to the ""flood door"" and see that it's full. I need to tell the owner so I rush to the attic door. A guy is there and asks why I'm so worried that the flood room is flooded. That's what it is supposed to do. I explain that it shouldn't be at it's max and I need to tell the owner. He convinces me that it's normal and I wake up.",,
4114S,"1.) I'm in a classroom, seemingly high school. We had just been playing a simulation game where we decided which stocks would have the highest return. The teacher announces the results out loud, starting with me. I think that I've made 1.9 million in the simulation and am very proud of myself. He goes to the next person announcing they are in the top 5. I'm confused as to why I'm not in the top. I look at a sheet in front of me, it's a score card. I've only made $1,900 - one of the lowest scores. I remember that I did the project very fast and made guesses. Next time, I vow, I will do proper research and do it the right way.",,
3647S,"1.) I'm on a chef game show where each contestant is responsible for a cooking station. Nobody seems to know what they're doing. Plates roll down to me and I'm standing in front of a cleaning station, but I don't want to solely be the cleaner. I'm confused by the rules. The announcer then says we all need to grab a valuable kitchen utensil. Everyone rushes to grab something, but I can't seem to find anything useful. I become really angry that nobody is sharing the rules or helping me out.    2.) I'm at a grocery store, feeling lucky that I got there as it first opened and there are no lines. I get what I need and go to check out. I forgot something so I run quickly to get it and by the time I get back to check-out, it's completely packed and I have to wait in a very long line. I debate if I'm going to stay or leave.",,
6902L,"1.) I'm sitting on top of a car at night with my partner. I'm noticing that I can see ""another dimension"" in which things to be falling out the sky as the same time is the current reality, though nobody else can see them. Some of the objects are celestial in nature - comets, stars, etc. Other objects are physical in nature, planes and other kinds of things. It doesn't appear to be happening on the regular plane of existence. I point out objects as they fall to my partner and ask him if he can see them. He says no. I begin to describe them in more detail and he beings to see. An old biplane then falls onto the ground upside down. There's a pilot inside but he doesn't seem hurt. He's just hanging upside down in his seat.     2. I'm walking around the galley of a medium-sized boat, not quite a sailboat, maybe something like a large fishing vessel. It's daytime and the captain or some other guide is walking me and others around the inside asking us to take a look out the windows. I'm unable to see out clearly, just they we are in the middle of the ocean, the windows are covered in scratches and worn with salt water. The captain comments about how we're coming up to the cafe for lunch. I can see into the cafe even though I am still on the boat. I see it's very crowded with a wait and we'll need to park the boat before going into the cafe. The captain then aggressively backs in under the cafe in the middle of the ocean. I can now see the water and there's large blue and white ice cubes everywhere. I'm delighted to see the ice. The captain continues to recklessly back into the ""parking lot"" under the cafe and I wonder if we might crash. I think that he must know what he's doing and stop worrying.    3.) I'm a dinner with my colleague and a few of her friends - all of whom are Korean. After the meal, we are writing little doodles on pieces of scrap paper we have. I write something about her boyfriend and how I think he's attractive and how I have an innocent little crush on him. It's all very lighthearted. I watch as the guy next to me writes a note in Korean and I wonder what the words say since I can't read it. All the papers get shuffled up and I realize that I didn't separate mine out, I absolutely don't want my colleague to see my scribbles. She leafs through them and finally gets to mine, confused by what she's reading. I explain to her that's it's not really real and that she doesn't have to worry! It's very silly. I tell her that she should be lucky to be with him! She is upset with and I am so embarrassed. (He is not present). She tells me that she can no longer date him, knowing that I feel this way. I feel so bad, trying to explain it like a celebrity crush kind of thing but she wants nothing to do with him now - or me.    4.) I'm moving quickly through an office building, following a path that I don't seem to recognize. I have an understanding that I am supposed to be doing something, but I'm unsure what exactly. I continue walking along a path when I see a young guy walk past me. We both kind of edge each other as though we're racing but maybe we don't know it. Finally I walk super fast to pass him completely, and then start running. When I begin running, I come to understand that I am in an indoor marathon taking place inside a giant complex of office buildings that feels like a huge airport. I'm running faster now as I come to groups of people cheering us on at various intervals. At a certain point, I get lots and can't find the markers to point me in the right direction of the marathon. I come to a sky bridge and can see the owner of the marathon walking outside below. He is dressed up in a Holiday Inn branded suit and wearing royal robes. He's talking about how this marathon is sponsored by Holiday Inn to benefit Jesus. He goes on to say that participants can donate to support Jesus or simply run for free. As I go back to find my way, I am thinking about how there's no way I want to ""support Jesus"" or give my money to that guy. I think to myself that I'm just doing this for me. I round a corner and others are pointing me where to go. I still can't see the markers but go in the direction they are pointing, still disoriented. ",,
2567S,"1.) I'm watching a scene where a guy ordered ""genuine"" Thai takeout food for the first time ever. They're in a car sampling the food. Everything he had before this wasn't real. His daughter is taking out bay leaves from her meal for a fashion idea she had in mind.    2.) I'm participating in some epic scavenger hunt/maze in the desert. High dunes conceal the way. I guess the right path quickly. A woman joins me and we walk up a dune and win. The scene switches to an aquarium where we wait for the others to finish the dune game. Since we're early, we get to play with the seal who is running around out a tank and licking us like he's a dog. Eventually, we walk back through the dune maze into an Egyptian like ceremonial space.",,

176S,"1) a dream about swimming ... competitive swimming races. I think I was swimming? I can't swim in real life.   2) a dream about camping and we had to choose a campsite where no one else could see us. They were all at the bottom of my parents driveway (they live on 4 hectares of bush land)... a baby bear came up to me. It was white like a polar bear but lived in the bush... the mum came up to me and I was scared it was going to attack me. I don't remember what happened after that but I didn't die/get maimed.   3) I was in some kind of school environment. Members of my research team were also there.. I won some competition which put me to the next stage, which was to physically fight someone (more like wrestle.. no physical harm induced). I had to fight a girl who was my international exchange honours student a few years ago from the Donders... we had to wear costumes. PhD students from my team watched. I was torn between wearing tulle and a Xena warrior princess type outfit. I think I woke up before we actually wrestled/fought. ",,
8949S,1) a paper I'm about to submit got scooped  2) I was walking around outside and my hair was a mess and I couldn't decide whether to tie it up or leave it down as both looked terrible ,,
10114S,"1) Another weird dream that I went back to high school, and was complaining about being 30 years old and having to do P.E., a psychologist from my lab was also there, and the head of psych department was the principal.  2) I was playing with my mum's dog on my parents farm and there were suddenly snakes everywhere. In real life she's quite old but when she was younger she used to play with snakes, flipping them with their tails into the air, and it terrified us but she was never bitten. In the dream she did it with a really small snake, and it landed on her back, and it bit her before she could shake it off, and then she was dying before my eyes and I was bawling and called the poisons hotline and then a vet came and she ended up being saved... but while she was at the vets, the dream changed and then suddenly it wasn't that we were playing, it was that a small boy had thrown a jar of snakes at her.. and so then I had to find the boy.. and police were helping me look, and it was the son of my local politician (who is very nice) and I felt terrible but also I was furious about my dog... we caught him in the end, he was only about 7 years old...",,

5892S,"1) Ex-inlaws (though it was someone who was not actually my ex) demanded I give them my stock trading earnings rather than spend it on our house.  2) Some sexual dream involving prostitution, though I didn't know it at the time  3) A third dream I have trouble recalling. Vivid, yes, something involving a good number of other people",,
23426S,"1) I dreamed my spouse and I were shopping in Target after the pandemic was over and masks were not needed. My spouse was looking at clothing in a new ""any gender"" section (which doesn't actually exist in waking life. In waking life, my spouse IS nonbinary and often looks like they might be a trans woman.) In the dream, some youngish guys came through the aisle and began targeting my spouse for mocking and then threatening violence and trying to beat up my spouse, so we ran through the store to get away from them. Some Target employees tried to intervene but once the guys saw they weren't going to get what they wanted they ran out of the store and evading store security who wanted to stop them. My spouse then went to try on some items while I waited outside the fitting rooms, but a display shelf randomly broke while I was standing next to it and products spilled onto the floor and I got dirty looks from employees and shoppers who seemed to think I broke the display. I went out to wait in the car, crying and embarrassed, and then I woke up.    2) In a different dream, I was in what was supposed to be my old academic building from when I was in graduate school. The psych department secretary from my actual grad experience was there working the office, and a couple of especially prominent faculty figures were there in the dream, coming in and out of the office and doing things in classrooms. (these are faculty who I had in actual life experienced as rather condescending in general and possibly even creepy toward female grad students.) In the dream, everyone was trying to get me to go to an afternoon colloquium being hosted by one of those faculty members, but there weren't many other students seated in that room yet and I was trying to delay going in until closer to time because I wasn't comfortable being alone/alone-ish in a room with that faculty member unless absolutely necessary. Finally, another woman came up to me in the hallway and told me I was needed in another part of the building for some sort of emergency. I was surprised to see her, in the dream, because she was not affiliated with the psych department at all. (In waking life, this woman had actually been a supervisor of mine at a social services organization I worked for several years ago!) When I followed her to the front entryway of the building, there was some sort of undergraduate student demonstration taking place on the steps and front lawn, regarding some sort of protest or special cause, but campus police were approaching and we felt we might need to do something to try to diffuse a potentially dangerous situation. Then I woke up.   ",,
6022S,"1) I dreamt I was having open heart surgery with local anesthetic. I could feel the pressure from surgical instruments inside my chest. Woke up terrified.  2) I was with some friends going to a class at my old conservatory. We were half-heartedly social distancing as we walked, but restrictions were being lifted so we didn't try too hard. We passed what appeared to be a serial killer with a girl screaming in his trunk and ran for our lives. Even still, I was so happy to be with my friends.",,
12149S,"1) I found a sketchpad and wondered who the artist was. It turned out to have been my father, and I was astonished since I had no idea he could draw anything.  2) something involving several trans-Atlantic flights and much worry about luggage getting lost",,
8764S,"1) I had a birthday party post-quarantine and it was terrible, super awkward and no one wanted to be there, 2) I entered myself and my brother in a road race (also post-quarantine) and while we were running we got lost on the course and my dog ran away",,
23170S,"1) I lived overlooking a cliff by the ocean and there was a fire right outside my home coming closer and closer. Some firefighters appeared and put it out.    2) I was teaching in person and all of the parents of my students came into the classroom with them demanding to speak to me. Class was about to start and my lessons weren't ready so it was really stressful. Once class started the parents stayed and continuously criticized my teaching, saying things like I wasn't speaking loudly enough and my lessons weren't engaging. At the end of class one parent stayed behind and lectured me for a while demanding to know why his daughter hadn't been chosen as student of the week yet. At the end of the dream I felt  proud of myself for maintaining my composure.",,
5564L,"1) I returned to work at McDonald's, where I worked for 8 years as a teen/early 20s... I don't know why  2) I bumped into a research participant from one of my old studies, a quiet, sweet boy. He was friendly and I somehow accidentally led him to thinking we were dating, or interested.. I forget how.. but it was a mistake.. and then, he was saying that he had a holiday planned to see the jersey shore set, and did I object to him going and I said no.. and then when I met up with my actual boyfriend I told him and he helped me come up with a plan to let him down gently... :-/ ",,
5163S,"1) I was at a wedding and something got spilled on my outfit so I went to get changed but couldn't find any shoes to match so spent the whole wedding trying to find shoes and missed the whole thing.     2) I was visiting my parents in the country and there was this GIANT white tree near their house. It towered above all the others, and kind of looked like a giant mushroom.. but on top it was like a bowl, and then inside the bowl was this beautiful forest, growing up in the air. In the dream it had always been there my whole childhood, but no one had ever got up there to go inside. It was on fire inside the bowl and we didn't know what to do. ",,
10716S,"1) My boyfriend and I went on a beachside holiday with my parents and we (my parents and I) just fought the whole time    2) my boyfriend and I got engaged and I went to the inbal dror showroom to try on wedding dresses and Taylor Swift was there...?

3698S,"1) something about a heist...   2) our housemate announced she was going to jail and moved all her stuff out of our apartment and my boyfriend and I were trying to decide what to do...   3) I was in an underground shopping centre and there were two pop culture stores. In the first one I picked up something that was $10 reduced down from $15 and then there was some kind of riot and I got swept out of the store without paying. I couldn't go back so then just kept walking, but then to leave I had to go through the second store but they thought I was stealing from them so I lied and said I'd paid for it at the other store but I didn't have a receipt so they made me fill in a form and speak to a heap of people and wait for an email from the other store to confirm id bought it but the email didn't come and I was frustrated because it was such a dumb situation over a $10 thing Id rather I just paid for in the first place... ",,
24755S,"1) Something about going to a play (or being in one?) then something about a bus, and then turns out there was an opportunity to go get vaccinated, so off we all went. (The rest of the dream wasn't in the current covid reality, just suddenly we were going to get vaccinated.)  2) Jumping off a cliff into the water at a beach (bright and cartoonish), landing near an acquaintance and also near a scary-looking gull that turned out to be a pregnant mermaid type thing. I made a comment to my friend about how it was surprising that the way they stood up was the same process as how we (fat and pregnant humans) did. ",,
5598S,"1) the university reopened and I went back to work and had to run some ELISA assays but the neurochem lab had been moved to a new building, which was basically a shopping centre in my home town in real life, but in the dream inside was an AMAZING state of the art lab, and then I realised that I'd accidentally worn a work top, but tracksuit pants on the bottom (which is what I wear at home) and I was mortified but no one seemed to notice  2) Some friends and I were playing a board game and if you lost (I think!) you had to have sex with this young boy (maybe 20y old) who was a virgin and my friend Casey lost and we were supposed to be sharing a bed and I told her to go elsewhere and the boy made crude comments and the whole thing was really messed up. ",,

I had one suitcase on wheels and one large knapsack and a smaller bag and I was looking in the pockets of the small bag which was like a small rucksack. I was looking for my housekeys and I was trying to remember where I lived so I could figure out what to do when I got back and I was waiting for the Biden bus and outside there was some kind of food festival going on in a clearing, so some people went out and looked around at the food and cake and stuff like that and then Kitty Martin (a friend from work) was on the bus and she said she didn't have any cash to buy anything and I offered to loan her some money, and I was reading a book so I sat down to read and I put on my headphones to listen to music and then someone started talking to me; it was a gay guy and he was talking about hair stuff and he said he had made a commercial about hair oil & getting custom-made conditioner for shampoo. It wasn't a commercial, he said he was just talking about it and then Rachel Maddow was there and and the guy said to all of us ""I bet you all use conditioner on your hair, you would really like this stuff"" and Rachel Maddow and I were kind of looking skeptical, like that was a really selfish kind of thing to do, to get custom hair conditioner and Rachel Maddow said she never uses conditioner anyway and I said I use it sometimes but usually not and then the gay guy was just trying to be friendly and funny and then people kept saying we were waiting for the Biden bus and the Biden campaign was sending a bus to pick us up, and I was thinking when I got back to Chelsea (Massachusetts) where I was  living, how would I get in my apartment then I remembered I had my keys and I had just moved into that apartment so I wasn't really familiar with the name of the neighborhood and I was picturing myself opening the door: it was an old building and I was remembering the apartment and I was trying to tell someone it wasn't a really great apartment but actually it had a neat, big kitchen with a freshly sanded wood floor which was very plain and simple and then one room was kind of messy or torn up or something and I was thinking to myself ""you know, I guess I do live there; I haven't lived there very long, but that's my house and I was kind of relieved that I didn't live in Fresno (California) anymore, a town I absolutely hate, and then I was back waiting inside the nonfunctioning bus waiting for the Biden bus and I was wondering what time it would get there and thinking we would get back home really late, when the bus finally arrived and we got on. The digital sign on the front of the bus said ""BIDEN"" and we were driving through the clearing area and there was the food festival which had really expanded and there were all these cake stalls and cakes that were shaped into little house with very colorful frosting, and I said ""why didn't we come here before, we didn't even know this was here,"" and then someone reminded me we did stop at the food festival at first but it wasn't really going strong at the time, and we were driving through and looking out the window from the BIDEN bus. At one point before the Biden bus arrived, a smaller bus had arrived and we thought that was the Biden bus but it turned out to be driverless, so we went back to the other broken-down bus to wait for the real Biden bus.",,

14425L,"A game-like dream: my character was a female warrior. The landscape was not realistic, perfectly flat plain bounded by blocky mountains. My perspective alternated between first person and map view. I was exploring the plain until I came across a town (identified by a raised dot on the map) on a low hill.     In the town was a vendor, so I was going through his stock, which took the form of a pull-down menu. As I compared the options, I accidentally clicked on ""Vampire"" and bought one, without even knowing how much I spent. Luckily there was an ""undo"" button, because the vampire cost 100 gold (which was the majority of what I had) and I had no use for it. After undoing that purchase, there were two others that I was considering: ""Stalker,"" an undead creature that the explanatory text said moved slowly but was good at smelling out treasure, or ""Baby,"" which was less expensive but had only half the sense of smell. I decided to purchase two stalkers, because between the pair of them, they were certain to lead me to the treasure I sought.     The stalkers were released onto the map as soon as I purchased them, so I didn't have time to further peruse the vendor's inventory, but had to run after them. Even though they supposely moved slowly, they had a head start and I had a hard time catching up. It seemed like they could run almost as fast as I could! I decided to take a second to mount my horse, which moved faster than I could on foot, and then I could keep up with them easily.     The stalkers led me back toward the mountains from which I had come, but further along the range to an area I had missed, where there was a big castle. I realized the treasure must be in there, and was glad that my purchase had paid off. The stalkers disappeared into the castle, and I followed them, but guards soon attempted to detain me. I fought them off easily, and then was challenged by the king, whose red color marked him as hostile. I slew him promptly and without second thoughts - I was in a hurry to catch up with my stalkers! In the process I accidentally wounded one of the resident monks, which I felt a little bad about since they were non-combatants, and that led to more guards chasing me, but they weren't a real threat so I dispatched the few near me and hurried on, evading the ones that were further away.      Although I had lost sight of the stalkers in first-person view, I could see their progress on my map, so I took the same route through a series of corridors that led into a big open hall. There were many minor treasures along the way that I stuffed in my pockets: decorative medallions on ribbons that were non-magical but probably worth a bit of cash, and two different jewelry displays that each contained two pairs of stud earrings with different gems. I thought the latter might be magical but in my haste I had no time to inspect them closely or try them on, so I also shoved them in my pockets for later. I thought it was interesting that the earrings here all came in fours: it must be the fashion in this country to wear two matching sets at once.     I was heading toward a gold dot that appeared on my map, marking the location of the main treasure at the far end of a large hall: it was the ""Sang R√©al."" As I neared the treasure hall I was confronted by a father, mother, and teenage daughter, Asian immigrants, who were its caretakers, and determined to protect it. I had no wish to harm them, since they posed no threat, so I continued through the hall and opened the chest that contained the treasure. Inside the large chest was a tray containing a small box that fit in my palm: this contained the precious object.     ""What is it?"" I asked the family of caretakers. I could tell they were stocked and slightly offended that had barged in so aggressively to loot something that I didn't even know much about. (OOCly I did know what the treasure was, but ICly my character didn't know, a mental disparity that felt just like it would have in a WL RPG.)     They explained that the Sang R√©al was the blood of the god. Some believed that the one who drank it would also become a god, but only if they were pure of heart. My character reflected cynically that it would be awesome to become a god, but she had no illusions about the purity of her heart, so she was not tempted. The family appeared so devoted and sincere, she realized with a sinking feeling that she was not going to walk out with the treasure after all: what would be the point, if she couldn't actually use it? Something like this was too marvelous to just sell for a bit of cash. Moreover, it was evident that they were willing to lay down their lives to protect it, and as callous as she was, she couldn't bring herself to kill this family.  So she quickly resigned herself to leaving the Sang R√©al behind, but decided to let the family go through the motions of talking her out of it.     ""Don't you want to try it?"" the father asked me. I thought he must be tempting me deliberately: knowing that my heart was not pure, and I would die if I drank the god's blood. But when we opened the small box, it contained a silver pendant on a chain. The pendant had the form of a stylized animal mask, like a taotie. I wasn't going to drink anything, but I let him put the chain around my next. The pendant hung down at waist level, and transformed into a large black war belt. I realized that it was taking a form that revealed the essence of my character. I admired the magic and gave it back.    The father wanted to try it on next. He started commenting that he is pure: he never even had sex. I responded skeptically: ""But you have a daughter!"" ""Yes,"" he admitted, but protested that he had never figured out how it works. I worried that he might be tempted to drink the blood. When he put the chain around his neck, the pendant transformed into a large silver styled ship. I wondered if the pendant revealed the kind of gods we would be if we did successfully drink the blood, our area of influence. War made sense for my character, and travel for his, given that he had come to this land as an immigrant.     I noticed that only the father and daughter were next to me: the mother was still on the far end of the hall. Were they deliberately stalling me while she tried to get help? But if it came to a fight I thought I could take on the guards, so I lingered to indulge my curiosity.    The daughter tried the pendant next. She put it on backwards, and it transformed into a loose silk robe. Across the back of it was printed lines of text, narrating a story that I realized told her future. It suggested that she was destined to become a devotee of the god of healing (possibly named ""Makris"") and aid her village. I wondered why anyone would want to know their future-but at least it seemed to be a positive one, and maybe discovering it will give her a sense of purpose and direction.     I convinced her to wear the pendant in the front so we could see what emblem it would transform into. It turned into a sort of leather toolbelt and apron marked with measurements that the father identified as a fishwife's belt. I figured that might become her day job. The father and daughter now suggested that I wear the pendant backwards like a robe, just as the daughter had done initially. I protested that I didn't want to know my future, but curiosity made me give in. The man wrapped the cloth around me, and to my dismay I found myself completely bound in a sheathe of fabric, lying flat on the floor, my arms pinned at my sides, just as a flurry of guards burst into the room.    Had the family pretended kindness only to betray me? I thought it very likely and cursed myself for trusting them... until the guards went out another door, they freed me from the cloth, and I realized that they had wrapped me up to conceal and protect me. My anxiety about betrayal melted into trust and gratitude, and I was glad that I had dealt gently with the family. At this point, there was no way I was going to make off with their treasure, so I returned the treasure to them. Though giving it up stung I little, I consoled myself by thinking, hell, if I change my mind I can always invade the place again someday. But I didn't think it likely. I also felt a new sense of purpose, and told the girl that I also intended to honor the god of healing. After all, I reflected, this was very compatible with my primary god of war!    I was about to leave the castle, but as the scene ended the game suggested a specific upgrade to my character. This led me to discover an upgrade interface I hadn't known about before. I already had three points to spend, so I wondered if I had missed this feature earlier in the game. The interface let me scroll through various upgrades that would specialize me into a class. I started comparing the benefits of each class. Hunters got special mounts and animal companions, but I was happy with the default mount. I tried to find the upgrade that the game had suggested, and thought it might be one of the druid options. I was still fiddling with this interface and reading the details of the different options when the dream ended.   ",,

Instead I spent some time trying to harvest the fish and snails in the water and repeatedly drowning (which I knew was without risk as I just respawned). I finally killed one shark (it was more electricity than a laser, but highly targeted) and we seemingly moved onto the next level, the crowded bleachers surrounding the pool--some kind of school spirit event was going on. I targeted a few of the sharks from the balcony, but it was made difficult by the jostling students. This time the laser was a focused red beam. Eventually my friend Max (a real person) took over, and targeted a different kind of monster (something that looked sort of like the pokemon Croagunk); as he killed it and raised the laser with a flourish, he cut into the belly of one of the water polo players who was being towed from the pool by a ref. The player was apologetic, though also sad about his lethal injury, and Max was appalled. This all still had the feeling of being a video game. ",,

Soon the content of the article became immersive, a new dream.    It described rituals of human sacrifice. The sacrifice was supposed to be voluntary, but I reflected that people might be motivated less by religious devotion than by fear or anxiety of being left in the world without any means of support, like the ""voluntary"" self-immolation of widows in premodern India.     The article did mention that it was possible to refuse to be sacrificed, and those who opted out were entitled to receive alms called ""poldina,"" which took the form of pieces of split wood, about a foot long and two inches thick, that would have been used to light the pyre.

The actual theme is fictional.  I was angered that the bride's mother was giving all the honors to her side of the family and her friends, and my mother was getting no respect or credit  for all her contributing help.  In reality, my mother had already passed by the time my son was married and there were no problems between the bride's mother and me.",,

We decided to protest something but it was a very weird protest - we were in a room, and people would come and for some reason they weren't on our side, although some were and would join us. And eventually we had to lock the people who were against us out of the room, but they were trying to get it. And then I got high with my dad, and it was nice having the people against us locked outside of the room. Someone who was against us also was like shaming people for their weight, so I was talking to those people and trying to make them feel better. Then when I went back to sleep after getting up I had a funny dream where I was in a games room with my boy friend but also other family members from time to time, and we were playing a game and so were some guys next to us, but somehow the games like interwove so at certain times we all had to say certain things.

They had 20 minutes to answer 4 out of 6 questions, but some of them answered all six: they weren't in a classroom, they were allowed to walk around of city to complete this, which doesn't make any sense. So I went down to 6th ave and back up Elizabeth to ""supervise"" to make sure they didn't cheat, but that wasn't a great plan. Then there was a new house my parents moved into without ever seeing it, and there was a woman there for dinner (I think my boss's assistant?) but we had limited silverware so I couldn't set the table properly but the dishwasher was done so I could have, but I set the place for my mom and aunt first because they would be upset if they didn't have all the utensils they needed.

I went into first aid mode and found a first aid kit in the house, but the kit was empty except for one cold pack that had a hole in it, so the power stuff was leaking out into a ziplock bag which also had a hole in it.

3349L,"a lot of dreams. First one with my dead father, he was alive and studied, he had a presentation at our home and his teacher was there. In the dream i remember he started drinking again because of the stress. I was scared of him like i used to.   Another dream. I was part of a adventure group who lived in an old wooden library. We were attacked by an enemy - middle aged guy, typical villain type - and prepared the library for the intrusion.  He still found a way into it through a hole in the cellar where a creature lived that didn't like light - it was a friend of ours.  Villain also found a collar there with old coins which he thought must have been ours.  Later it was revealed that they were the creature's who just forgot that it was a human hundreds of years ago. Oh and the library collapsed but no-one was hurt.  We sat outside and thinking of what to do,  the creature meditated and i sat next to him and when i touched him he showed me a dream...  Next dream I was running in my old hood, because i was sad and angry. During my run i met people and started to remember it's pandemic time and i could infect people by running and not wearing a mask. So i stopped behind a plant and cried. A little later a worker came with an excavator and he took me on his vehicle trying to give me a lesson for life but actually it was more like torture- he had a knife and tried to cut me while driving on the street,  i cried and shout for help but no one reacted to me.  Later i got away don't remember how,  but was on my way back home and had to climb over a hughe red car, that parked half on the way half on the street. The driver sat inside - a younger man,  typical macho man - and whined there was no free space for his car here.  I told him to slowly drive around the block until the person came he was waiting for.  He did so,  i went around the next corner just to see free space. But he was too far gone to tell him.   Last dream, my boyfriend and me had a new house and there were lots of family members with us for some celebration.  Our daughter had a sister and they played together.  I wandered through the house and was happy to see all the bigger rooms and furniture.  ",,

There were police all around the front of the house but for some reason his selling the house also cleared him of whatever he was wanted for and they left as did he and his family, or so I thought.  There were still people around the house and I saw things- a naked woman riding a bicycle outside but when I got her attention to tell her that she should dress, she was dressed. I told her that I saw her naked and she smiled and said I was wrong and suddenly had even different clothes on.

7546L,"A young man with whom I was vaguely acquainted (a student?) introduced me to a viking ship burial in a cave on the grounds of an old sawmill in a town called Harmon, in Maine. [Day residue: Last night reading random news before bed, I saw a headline along the lines of ""the real discoverers of America,"" paired with an image that, on scrutiny, appeared to be a seated viking. I was reminded of something circulating on Facebook that my husband had read me earlier in the day about a Maori ""discovering"" Britain in 1806. Google supplies the link: https://nzhistory.govt.nz/moehanga-becomes-first-maori-visit-england]    I was really impressed by the viking ship burial-though it manifested not in the form of a ship, but a large flat marble slab carved in the shape of a bed, sort of like some of the old medieval/Renaissance sarcophagi you see in churches, but in dimensions much larger and flatter (it was underfoot, flush with the ground level of the cave). A man and two women were carved (in low relief) as though sleeping in the bed, so I wondered if it was symbolic or a compound burial (and if the latter, if the two women had been sacrificed for the occasion).     My eye caught a narrow line of text running along the head of the bed, so I got out my iPhone and started trying to document it with pictures. There were a variety of different scripts, but I could read the word ""ICELAND"" at one point.     I was really excited about the site and wanted to bring my husband to see it. The visiting hours were normally on Wednesday after 6pm, and I thought that would be fine as it is getting toward summer so it is light in the evenings. In the dream, it was currently late afternoon on a Thursday, so I thought I would have to come back next week.     Later (I think it was the same dream), I was in a cryogenic facility, everything clean and white. Looking down at a frozen body in a vat, I wondered if it would be a good idea to also have myself  frozen, but... I reflected that it would be reasonable to clone myself first. After all, both cloning and cryogenics were unproven science, so if one was going to risk one, why not both? But obviously the cloning would have to be done first.     Apparently I went ahead with this plan, because next thing I knew, I had been revived from cryogenesis. ""What year is it?"" I asked the attendant who was helping me. I remembered that I had been frozen in 2006 so I was prepared for something decades in the future. ""It's 1999,"" she said. This was perplexing, but we walked by a refrigerator with a calendar on it and it was clearly marked with the year ""1999,"" so I didn't think she was lying. But how was it possible that I had been revived six years before I had been frozen? Since when did cryogenesis involve time travel?     This changed things. If it was now six years before I had been frozen, this meant another version of me was out there, living my regular life at this point. I would have to take care to avoid her. The laboratory where I had been revived was in New York City, a place I had never lived and rarely visited in life, so I decided maybe I would just live here for awhile. Then in 2006, when the other me got frozen, I could resume her life.   ",,

I think it was a Victorian house, but it was not their parent's real life house. We were on the ground floor, and there was a sizable fire in another section of the ground floor. I think we were in the living room while the kitchen & dining room were in flames. (Smoke didn't seem to exist.)  We were not in immediate danger, but had to get out of the house immediately. We each had a bag and were quickly putting some items into our bag before we fled the house. We were not going about gathering items; we were only packing things within reach. I had a small duffle bag. As I put the charging cords for my electronic devices in my bag it occurred to me that those would be very easy to replace, but since I didn't have time to consider whether or not to bring each item with me, I just put everything in the bag as quickly as I could. I was aware that I was packing more than my cousins.   We were out of the burning house, and the goal was to get away from the house before it blew up. There was a section of the house that contained something flammable and we knew that when the fire got there the whole house would explode.  We went in different directions, though we seemed to be in the back yard because the distance we could go was limited. I went towards the far right corner, which enabled me to far farther than either of my cousins. There was some type of disturbance in the fence to do with a tree and a creek on the other side; a section of fence that had been pushed by the tree was tilted and I as able to climb through the opening to the other side where the creek was which would provide more shelter from the imminent explosion.  Scene: Something about an airplane and a runway and my dad.   Scene: Someone non-urgently needed a doctor, and I recommending a friend. That friend was a sea gull who was walking along with a number of other sea gulls, about seven altogether, all of whom could talk, and I had trouble telling him apart from the other sea gulls. This made it difficult for me to point out who I was recommending as a doctor.  Scene: I had an aerial view of a nice section of LA.  There was an arc of small mountains behind this community, and the homes were in the crescent shaped ""bowl"" between the mountains and the cliff of the coastline. The land below me was covered in houses; nice middle-upper class houses. Some had a pool. There was a good amount of trees and greenery. My gaze started at the ridge of the bowl and came closer. Directly below me was a mansion with a pool, both were substantially larger than any of the others in the area. The mansion was behind me. All I saw was the fasade. It looked like an Italian stucco high-end hotel. It was about four stories high and faced an equally wide clam-shaped infinity pool that went to the edge of the cliff overlooking the ocean. I've always wanted to swim in a pool like that. I dropped down into the pool. There was no fear component to this.  I went in feet first, and put my arms above my head so my body could go through the break in the water made by my feet - like competitive divers do to minimize the splash.  The force of the drop took me all the way down to the bottom of the pool where I consciously sunk into a crouched position so I could use my leg strength to spring up and propel myself towards the surface. I made sure to tilt my head back as I broke the surface so my hair wouldn't be in my eyes. There were many people throughout the pool, though none where I surfaced. I was wearing straight jeans and white converse sneakers and I don't know what on the top; none of it weighed me down or caused a hindrance in the water.  I made my way to the edge of the pool where it was shallower-not the infinity edge in the front, the edge of the right along the cement patio. Some people were sitting on the edge with their feet in the water, others were standing in the shallow water drinking their cocktails where the waitstaff could easily get to them. I made my way towards an empty section of the edge of the pool. When I got there Ellen Pompeo said hello to me. We went towards the pool's stairs together.",,

In one I was in a department store but they were moving every one out because they were closing for a staff holiday party the exit though was through some lady's cluttered house. A man I didn't know was helping me climb up a sort of rope ladder made of stuffed toys and other stuff. I commented that I had had to do this before once and I really appreciated his help.  I can't remember whether it was the same dreama nd just a different scene, but I was having dinner with my husband and a bunch of people whom he was trying to impress - like a job interview. I think it was successful. But at the end of the dinner I was sitting i nthis weird casual pose and I couldn't move from it and I was worried that it would ruin his chances of impressing them.  After the dinner I was walking down a ramp inside some sort of building and my two best friends were at the bottom. I ran to to them saying ""oh my gosh my two favourite people in the world!"" and then turned back to say, ""other than my husband of course"" but I couldn't see him. I hugged my friend Anna and the other friend who was a best friend in the dream but I can't picture who it was now. I then looked for my husband but couldn't find him.  In another dream I was in some sort of large foyer. There was one bathroom and we were going to be in the building for a long time. I went to use the bathroom but the door latch wouldn't close. When I saw the toilet it was gross and wasn't flushed, so then I had the awkward thing of leaving the bathroom, not using it, but people thinking I had been the last to use it. I have this kind of recurring nightmare all the time.",,

We were at a rooftop gathering.  When people were leaving said gathering, a few discovered it was my birthday. I played it down. Their reaction was something along the lines of it was a nice casual gathering, but ""insufficient"" for a birthday party.  Something about taking the elevators downstairs.  Nearly everyone went together in the elevator before me; I was basically left behind.  I did try to get the elevator I was in  to catch up.  Scene: A woman who owns a coffee shop was  teaching a workout class; I saw this on a screen of some sort. A friend took me to her yoga class; the coffe shp turned fitness instructor was the teacher. I did not like teacher and was on edge & anxious the entire time that she would kick me out for no apparent reason.  Scene: I was at a gymnastics gym. I went to great lengths to move/re-space the bars so I could swing on them. While I was able to move the bars apart, they were still too close to me swing freely.  Scene: I was in a grocery store. The layout was more like a storage facility than a real life grocery store. I saw people I knew but made an effort to go the other direction or turned my face away so they wouldn't see or recognize me.  ",,

7104L,"Although I was married to my husband in the dream, I dreamed we were both back in grad school at Kent State University (where we both went in waking life years ago before we met), he was in the math dept and I was in the psych dept. It was about time for fall classes to start, but I was for some reason applying to law school to change prospective career paths. I thought that if I became a lawyer, I would be respected more by my husband and earn good money.  The law school selection process was underway, and they had all applicants cram into an auditorium to see how we reacted to various skits and tasks. The chairs were oddly shaped and I kept sliding out of mine or otherwise having difficulty sitting. At one point, a woman planted among us but actually working for the selection process began screaming ""I like Trump! I like Trump! Who's gonna fight me!"" and we all ignored her even though I wanted everyone to know that I did not like Trump. Then one of my math faculty members (who I had met in waking life at a picnic with my husband) pretended to have a heart attack in the hallway and I was the only one who rushed out of the selection hall to help.  I was embarrassed to discover it was just another part of the selection process.  Then I realized two things with horror -- one was that I had not yet prepped the Intro to Psych course I was supposed to teach and it started the next day, and I had neglected it because I was trying to get into law school instead. Two was that nobody was wearing masks and we were all in this crowded auditorium together probably spreading COVID19.  Then I suddenly woke up.   ",,

12381S,"American soldiers, eighteenth-century or modern or both, mount an attack on the royal palace of Burma using war elephants. The line of elephants appears to be miles long, winding across the landscape. I join, but am almost last in the line. It occurs to me that unlike a horse, I have no idea how to interact with an elephant, so I won't know how to calm it if it becomes nervous or excitable. I'm also concerned for our safety because several times we have to cross roads with load, fast-moving cars that do not seem inclined to slow down for us.     As the battle line wends closer to the palace, I see a small shaggy pony trotting along behind it, and an even smaller foal trying to keep up. ""Stay back with your foal!"" I encourage the larger pony, assuming it must be the mother.     My division's battle plan is to attack the stables, where we will free the king's horses as a diversion. I enter the stall of a nervous white horse and start dismantling the small beige plastic box, a square about three inches in diameter and one inch thick, that controls the locking mechanism. After breaking open the plastic face, I pull out some internal wiring, and this unlocks the stall. My companions have been doing the same in all the other stalls.     Now we regroup in the paddock, our victory complete. Some of the Burmese king's horses and elephants have been captured as prizes by our soldiers. One of our officers begins to introduce a Burmese who has changed sides to join us. He is making an excessively long speech about it, so I encourage him to hurry so we can get out of here, which annoys him.     As we file away from the now-looted palace, George Washington is with us, and I notice that he has his old horse back. (Maybe the Burmese king had captured it, and this was the pretext for our battle?)    Later, I return to the now-looted and ruined palace. I am pulling a cart that is occupied by the ghost of a young boy, who has offered assistance. The ghost says he needs a tie in order to use his magic, and the environment complies by presenting him with a sort of hand-towel on a round white plastic ring, which he puts around his neck so that the towel drapes down the front in the manner of a tie. Apparently this will do.     Then the ghost says he needs numbers. I see the numbers ""9"" and ""10"" appear near his head. These are numbers that he remembers from life, because they were near his age when he died.     [Day residue: In class on monday a student showed a painting made by a friend, a distorted figure surrounded by numbers. She explained that the friend had a mental illness that kept him pre-occupied with numbers, and he had made the painting as a self-portrait, and later took his own life.]     Apparently these fetters allow him to work his magic by reminding him of his former life. Now he manifests his power, which allows us to see two other ghosts, a boy and a girl, that inhabit the grounds of this palace. I had inferred their presence previously, during the invasion, so I had come back to try to find them.   ",,

4604L,"As usual I had many dreams, but one was about my dad, so I ignored and largely forgot the other dreams.    -A dream from earlier in the night involved masses of people who were evacuating or fleeing or something. They were all going in the same direction on foot. They were in very close proximity to each other (think standing in a crowded subway). They were gridlocked and at a standstill. Interestingly, I was able to move freely and without any hinderence through the throngs of people. (That's all I remember.)    -My dad called me. He needed to go to Costco for new contacts because he was out and couldn't see and couldn't drive himself. I was ready and willing to help; we scheduled for me to drive him, and on the Costco online drop down menu it showed my name as the person who would be brining him in. A short time later he called me back. He was afraid his wife would be upset if she found out I drove him, so he was going to take Uber instead. He'd never taken Uber, didn't know how it worked, but insisted he'd figure it out. My mom and her sister and some friends were going out to lunch at a restaurant across the street from Costco, so I went with them - just to make sure my dad was ok and to help if he needed assistance. We parked in a parking garage. My mother, her sister & friends went towards the restaurant. As I walked through a hallway in this parking structure I passed a martial arts room used exclusively for stretching that was part of a retirement home. It had Asian characters above the door. (In real life my dad's wife is Asian.) I looked inside; the room was extremely small, about the size of a BC freshman dorm room, with some thick red mats on the ground that were not big enough to be used for stretching, and no people. When I got outside this parking structure, my dad's car was parked along the curb. Inside the car I saw CAL University paraphernalia including a blanket. This indicated that my dad's wife's niece was a student at CAL, which is nearby, that they were part of her college experience, and somehow this imparted me with the knowledge that since dorms are closed due to COVID she was staying with them. (I woke up in a terrible mood! In real life my dad ditched me on the way to BC. As in, he insisted we fly from California to Boston several days early so he could show me around town, he came to my mom's house the morning of departure, said he'd meet me at the Airporter bus, and then he never showed up. Luckily BC housing allowed me to move into the dorm early. He also gave me hell about brining his wife to graduation, then didn't show up, and then yelled at me about it. And then he took his wife's niece on a tour of colleges in the US - which he definitely didn't do for me. I was in such a mad mood that I went back to sleep, just to dream something else and have a better start to the day.)    This dream involved a Yeti falling in the forest and injuring a slug, which picked up a seashell to cover itself like an animated cartoon.",,

15236L,"At a craft brewery somewhere near a forest. After getting some drinks, my friends and I were hanging out on two bare mattresses on the floor in a side room, waiting our turn to buy some extra brews to bring home. It was taking a really long time, like more than an hour, and eventually we started thinking we would just head home empty-handed. I was reclining on a mattress on one side of the room talking to D (an old friend from high school), and two other friends (vague DCs, no connection to WL) were on the other side. He mentioned that he had no way home because he hadn't brought his car, and I eagerly offered to give him a ride. It would be nice to have someone to talk to on the long drive back - even if his house in Marion was another hour to the west of mine, which was already two hours away (I felt like we were in central NY, somewhere east of Syracuse).     [Note: D had lived about an hour west of me, I think, but was ""Marion"" really the name of the town? I have that uncertainty that one wakes up with, not sure if a dream detail is real. I can't think of any other possible names for the town where he lived, so I will now look up ""Marion"" to see if it is a real place:    [Google confirms that ""Marion"" is indeed a town about a half hour west of where I lived at the time, so I'm going to propose that this is a real memory and it was actually the placed D lived.]    There was a guy who worked at the place who was dressed in a primitive style. [WLR: late last night watched new videos by Danheim and Wardruna that featured men dressed like this.] I was asking him about an event they held in the woods nearby, somewhere in between a LARP and reenactment of Iron Age life.     ""What is your policy on edges, points?"" I asked her, wondering if I should specify that I was talking about weapons, but figuring she would get it. I use ""she"" now because in the course of the conversation, the person I was talking to had transformed from a bearded guy in primitive garb to an elegant, dark-haired Goth woman in a corseted red and black dress. In classic dream fashion, I did not notice any change. I don't know if it was the same person (because the place changed too, from inside the room to outside the building) or if there was just a missing transition, but it felt like the same conversation had continued without missing a beat.    ""They're fine,"" she said, and I was pleased by their commitment to realism. Maybe I would come back and take part.    ""What do you call your group?"" I asked her.    ""Royals of Chaos,"" she answered. I made a mental note to look it up online when I was back at my computer.     But while I had been talking to her, D had walked off into town with another guy. They were now out of sight, so I excused myself and hurried after them. The road into town was one of those narrow European streets with no sidewalks, just the abrupt transition from a one-lane stone-paved street to two- or three-storey buildings on both sides. I tried to remember where I had parked... I thought that up ahead the street would open into a plaza, and then if I hooked a sharp left I would find my car, but I wasn't sure.     I wanted to text D to let him know I was still planning to give him a ride, but when I pulled out my phone I had no signal. In the upper-left corner of the screen there were no bars at all, just the words ""NO CRAFTING.""     I realized I would be annoyed if D had gotten a ride home with the other guy, just because I had lagged behind for a few minutes. We had made an agreement, and it would be rude to break it without telling me. Moreover, since I did offer to give him a ride, now I wouldn't be able to leave until I tracked him down, because I couldn't very well go if there was any possibility he might be waiting for me.

58S,"At first I was staying in Madison, WI (but not real Madison, where I went to undergrad) and was staying at hotel (which I'm pretty sure doesn't exist) that from the outside looked like a huge old, fancy townhouse/mansion with friends (at least one of whom I was messaging with yesterday in real life). In the dream I knew that we could have gotten their by Roissy Bus A (which I've taken to get from Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris to closer to central Paris so I could catch the metro to my aunt and uncle's apartment). In the dream I didn't make the France connection, I just knew the hotel was near the first stop and was close to an airport (I've only flown into Madison once, otherwise I've always driven). In ""Madison"" there was something about a beautiful wood design (possibly inspired by a picture another friend had posted online yesterday that included her gorgeous wooden coffee table) and a painting (one of my friends in the dream that I think was there but didn't  see used to live in Madison, and has recently been posting photos of her watercolor paintings). Eventually the dream transitioned to being in MN and I was talking to one of my MN friends (who I think was in the Madison segment too) about how she'd stayed at our friend/my ex-boyfriend's grandparents farm (it wasn't really their farm) via AirBnB, and we roadtripped down to visit them and see if we could stay there. When we arrived it was a huge property that I sometimes saw from above (last night I was watching Tiger King with friends, including those in the farm section of the dream, and this show had lots of aerial shots), and his grandparents didn't seem to know us (even though my friend Kelly was supposed to have stayed there before; I don't believe I've ever met Noah's grandparents in real life, not even sure they're still alive), but they were very friendly and tried to find me a space to stay in their barn AirBnB area; Kelly apparently had made a reservation again, but I had been a last minute addition. We were told that there was one prebooked group and possibly a second. Noah's grandfather said something about there being enough mattresses for everyone and I said something about having slept on the floor before and how I'd be fine (and I somehow newly carrying a sleeping bag under one arm). Without having ever discussed this with Noah (in the dream or in real life), I knew that his dream-grandparents were some of the sweetest, generous, salt-of-the-Earth people and that their grandkids would drop by from time to time to see them; I hoped Noah would drop by (in real life, he moved to Vietnam in July 2019 after we'd gotten back together for the first time in three years for the two weeks before he left, messaged regularly until he was here for a brief return home for his brother's wedding in October; we had amicably parted ways, and he's been dating an American in Vietnam since late 2019). Something more about mattresses with his grandfather (possibly inspired by watching Tiger King, where Joe Exotic blew a hole in his bed so it wouldn't be worth anything after he lost his court case and was being forced to surrender his personal property to pay the fine). At dinner the main AirBnB crew arrived (a family with kids) and we all sat at a long table for a pizza dinner. At first I was hanging back looking to find a seat, but ultimately I had to walk to the far other end sitting close to Noah's dream-grandfather. There wasn't any reachable pizza by me, and for some reason I didn't ask for anyone to pass me any. I got up and walked to the dessert table which offered basically all candy, presumably to make the kids happy. Some of it was brightly colored gummy candy (likely inspired by a BBC YouTube interview of Emma Thompson that I saw yesterday where she discussed having stolen some gummy candies from a sweet shop as a child), some was wrapped candy (possibly some were Now N Laters, which I remember liking when I was a preteen, they were mostly ok to eat with braces), I took a few pieces of different things, but don't remember eating them. It was at the dinner conversation that I learned that my friend Kelly was on her way to TN, I don't think I was going with her. The next day (don't recall where I slept, despite the earlier discussion) was warm yet somehow it was (or had recently been) cold enough that these ponds (about the size of a middle school pool) had large swaths of ice on them that were cut into long foot-wide sections people were competing to move across the pond almost like preparation old-timey ice cutting (which I only ever seen in the movie Frozen) for an ice house. One of my other friends was standing on one piece of ice and trying to push them across the pool with something like a gondolier's pole, and she was struggling to do so. I walked on the surface of the pond (without sinking) and asked why she didn't. After that's Noah's dream-Grammy (no idea if that's what his family called her, but in Tiger King last night there was someone called Grammy) asked what my mineral levels were (as though that was why I could walk on water). I told her that to my knowledge I didn't have any special mineral levels, but that if I didn't look down, I could walk across water without sinking (Looney Tunes rules, I guess?), though as she asked me, I wondered if I'd somehow used what my real-life family used to call ""Jesus boots"" (big, floating yellow plastic skis and matching floating orange poles that you could use to walk on water that we have at my Nana's cabin), but I don't think I did (Noah's family is very Catholic, mine isn't, though we are Christian, but maybe the Jesus boots reference was inspired by how President Trump has misguidedly said he wants everything back open by Easter).  The dream shifted and seemed almost part cartoon, and someone who I knew was a friend (but not anyone I recognized from real life) touched something in the barn and turned into a brown cartoon dragon (a friendly one) and something about different colored gems that made almost Sailor Moon animation style colored streams around him as he turned into the dragon. I think another unknown friend turned into something cartoon+y and purple?",,

I could see their rotting faces warped into faces of fear, despair, and crying out for help as they were probably drowned. Their bodies were wrapped in chains like a straight jacket and strapped to the ""floating"" island. That's all I remember. To put this into some context, I watch a show called Siren. They are beautiful but horrifying creatures and it uncovers the mystery of a siren genocide committed by the humans many years before the start of the show.

Then later there were some kids from high school who wanted to go on spring break together, but I think I felt uneasy about it because that doesn;'t fit well with social distancing, and there were some sort of rules for an elaborate game like capture the flag that came into play but i can't remember how, and also I feel like an awards ceremony or graduation or something.

Each prof was recording a message for us with a small silver microphone and I could watch them recording. James Danckert said that every morning he woke up and had to head back home. I wondered where the heck he was coming from?? He continued that he would read papers in the bathroom at school and fall asleep there and that it was filthy. I wondered if he just said that because he was having an affair. Then Brad Pitt was talking. He said, ""This is Brad... Taylor."" He had changed his name through marriage but everyone knew he was Brad Pitt. Then the recording turned into a movie of his humble beginnings. He worked as a cleaning lady, wearing drag and working with a partner (who was a woman and wasn't aware he was in drag). He was dirt poor and dirty. They went house to house asking people if their apartments needed cleaning. Once, they were standing by a busy road and Brad Pitt said, ""there's going to be a van of men who drive by us, then turn around and come back"" and they watched it happen, just as he said it would. The van turned around in Copenhagen and created a big bubble that the van floated in over traffic going back the direction they came from, crossing over a bridge. The cleaning woman realized that Brad Pitt had extraordinary powers, and that was how his celebrity was born.¬†    Maybe a separate dream or later in the same dream: I was sitting on a rock, kind of like a cliff edge or huge boulder. I was in a class, sitting with my¬†classmates. A lot of rock surrounding us was marked off with tarp. We weren't allowed to touch it because of the virus. There was a girl in an exercise bra and leggings who kept jumping down, or really falling down, a steep crack in front of us and then catching a ledge to start rock climbing. It was very scary because it was a huge drop if she didn't catch anything. We said, ""Is she crazy? She's going to hurt herself."" I looked to my right and the rock was full of lined crevices that looked perfect for rock climbing. I tried holding onto it. Some people looked at me like I was about to start climbing but I wouldn't dare because we were so high up. I realized I really missed rock climbing and wished I could still climb. Then I was with a trainer on the ground who was directing me to jump from one corner of a rock to an artificial hold that he rotated on a cylinder full of other hold options. The trainer was an older man wearing a tracksuit. I tried and just landed. ""Good,"" he said, ""do it again."" I practiced several times. It was hard. There was someone else there too, a young man. The trainer had videotaped me and he asked the younger guy to save the file. We connected it to a computer and I could see a bunch of files. I made a new folder on the computer called Hanna and dragged my files in there. We put the camera in a bag. The trainer asked if we deleted the files from the camera to make space, and I thought oh, we need to do that. I wasn't sure if the guy knew what he was doing at all with the camera.",,

4326S,"Dan and I were hanging out. Chris was there and so was Steve. Chris sighed seeing me and Dan together, like he couldn't take the sexual tension between us. Later it was just me and Dan. I hugged him and we lay down on the bed and kissed sort of quickly. I think I was really drunk. I wished we had had more of a moment of anticipation. We kissed more and it felt nice, but I didn't feel like Dan was really enjoying it. We spoke about Steve. I wished that Steve and I were in an open relationship and I didn't want to consider what Steve would say if he found out that I kissed Dan. Then there was a voice message from Steve in Japanese. I told Dan that Steve had been learning Japanese on Duolingo. Dan translated for me. Steve said it's over, but in some combination of words that I can't remember. I got so upset when I realized that we were really breaking up, abruptly, with no discussion. I didn't want to lose Steve. Then in the morning, Dan rushed out to get something, maybe breakfast, because we needed to leave soon. I walked around his apartment. I saw his roommate's bedroom which was very clean and had two beds in it. Then I went back to his bedroom and noticed he had two beds too, a big one and a small one. His apartment was very clean. I noticed that he had large photographs on the wall and they were all of him and me. I was surprised but felt glad that he also considered me a close friend even after years apart. Then people arrived and I was on the phone with Steve. He said, or someone there said, something about Anna. I asked, who's Anna? And Steve said the thing about Anna is... And said something very vague. At this point he was in the house. I kept asking and he kept giving vague¬†answers. I said I need you to tell me very quickly, a 60-second version, of who Anna is. I realized I needed to pack. We went to the bedroom and I started stuffing my things into my suitcase. A girl there helped me find the box for a mini puzzle I had. As I packed Steve continued to say non-things about Anna. When I was done I said that was way longer than 60 seconds and you haven't told me anything. I was yelling angrily and got worried that Dan would hear me and judge me. I found my swimming suit on the shelf with Dan's. They were matching, blue and see-through. Finally we were leaving and I realized that we had two more days in New York, and that I had thought we had a hotel booked but we didn't. I remembered one that I saw online that looked okay, clean but in a loud part of the city. I just didn't want bedbugs. We all headed out to go to the train station to go to the beach. I wondered if I should drop my bags off at the hotel first. Dan came out wearing a cape or something. Then it was just Steve and me finding the hotel. At this point it may have been a separate dream. We decided to go to the one I saw online. The people working there were very young, like teenagers. I called my mom and asked her where she stayed and whether it was too late to switch hotels.¬†",,
7591S,"Dan was giving birth to a baby with his girlfriend, but it was a kitten. He showed me a picture. Then Dan was in a field that was surrounded by a concrete wall (more like an empty lot) doing some sort of illegal sport or activity, and he disappeared after either the police came or there was an explosion. Steve and I looked for him but could only find his camera, which was still recording video. There was a pile of dead bodies in the field on a mattress. I worried that Dan had died too. Then I got a message from Dan, which was a hand-drawn picture of his cat. They were in the hospital.     In another dream, I was hanging out with Dan and Shelley. Dan and I kept holding each other very close. He teased that maybe we should just kiss. We went to a museum. As we walked up for a ticket with my mom, I was holding Dan in my winter coat and then I put him down.     Third dream: Steve and I were at the grocery store looking for a few particular items that we were asked to review for some sort of assignment. One of the items was a curry packet, the kind that you plop into a pot and heat up. While we were at the store I realized that we shouldn't both be in there. There were two young men shopping together, and they stood very close to me. I backed away when I realized we should be maintaining a 6-foot distance. I said to Steve, oh no, I forgot to bring your debit card! (The last time we went grocery shopping in real life, not dreaming, I took his debit card home with me by accident). We left through the parking lot with our items but hadn't paid yet. It was winter and there was snow on the ground. I didn't recognize the area we were driving through. I said wait, are you driving to your house? He said yes. I reminded him that we needed to go to my house for the debit card. Oh no, said Steve, I forgot. Sorry. We passed two big free-standing and hand-built swimming pools to our left, in the middle of farmland. I started to recognize it. I looked to my right and back as we were passing and finally glimpsed a big tall house. It was the house I lived in for a summer on Wilhelm street (in reality I lived there for a year and it was a different house from the dream house). I remembered that I would watch the neighbors across the street swim in their pools. Then the houses we passed were small and close together, like I remembered. Steve asked, how did you walk to school from here? Because it was so far away. I remembered that I walked through the park. Which was possible to do because it was just for a summer, and not during winter when I'd have to walk through snow. Then we were in someone else's apartment while they were sleeping. The person was a young man maybe in his 20s or 30s, and looked like someone I had been in a teaching workshop with. I think Steve and I were cooking so we could review the food before a deadline. I walked around looking for a kitchen and realized I was standing in it. It was very small, and more like a hallway. The sink was small and white and looked more like a bathroom sink. I turned on the sink kind of loudly and the man whose apartment we were in woke up and ran into the kitchen. We said sorry, we just needed to use your kitchen. Then I came to; Steve me and the guy had been drinking and I had passed out. Steve had washed my white t-shirt (which was like the black one I have from high school) and hand left it wrung out by the sink. There were pasta sauce stains all over it. I realized we had eaten pasta together while I was blackout drunk. Steve, I said. You didn't get the stains out. I started running the shirt under water and soap and worried that the stains wouldn't come out because Steve had already washed it. But the stains came out pretty quickly. Then I moved on to older grey stains I noticed on the shirt. Those started coming out too.",,

She never told me they were coming and, for most of the dream, I assumed she also was caught off guard by their appearances.    Since I was caring for her and did the shopping, we had little food to serve them.  Friend Bean was doing his best to help concoct something, anything on the stove.  The executive director of one place I work, Tammy, only brought several clear, very large plastic bags of vegetable oil, calling them ""olive oil"".  When Bean used the last of our actual olive oil, Tammy started to refill the bottle with vegetable oil and I could smell its more processed odor everywhere.  We ate some nebulous yellowish meal at little tables in our living area and I saw small paper review sheets strewn around.  The first one I read had the bubble completed next to ""disappointed"".  I felt horrible.    My mother was seated in a Lazy Boy chair, something I never had glimpsed while she was living.  I asked, ""Did you know they were coming?""  There must have been at least 12 people inside.  My mom was not the least bit understanding of my stress of not being made aware. Tammy offered, ""Yes, your mom invited us.  We are going to do this every Tuesday.""     Oh, horrors!  How expensive will this tradition be?  What if I must work my other jobs during these dinners?  In passing, Tammy mentioned I'll be teaching ""this week"".  What?!?   It already was Thursday in this dream.  Does she mean tomorrow?  I am not at all ready.  I haven't ever taught anything to a group.  Tammy pats her knees and joyously proclaims, ""Next Thursday.  We're all set!""  I forced myself to awaken.      Dream #2:  Tammy again inhabits this dream.  I am with a group of co-workers in maybe Peru.  IRL, most everyone wants nothing to do with anything foreign.  I recall one time we ate German food and Tammy may as well have served us live monkey brains, judging from the group's reaction.   Back to the dream, I was stressed my colleagues would be upset about finding themselves in Peru.  We were at an ancient burial site and, to me, it was fascinating.  The grave markers were colorful and covered by long metal lean-tos to slow degradation.    One person in our group became interested in one historical character, named Pino Suarez.  Where I found this name, I have no clue.  She wanted to find his grave, but everyone with more knowledge told us only that he is purported to be buried here.  Then two American Mormon boys walk up to us in their white shirts, ties, name tags, and gray pants; and they say, ""Follow us.""  They took us across rows of lean-tos and their graves.  Finally, in a nondescript row, at the very end, falling down a small mound of grass almost to the asphalt street beside it, was a gravesite for ""Tres Pinos"".  The Mormons told us this was his nickname and it was the only way the people of the area knew him.  There he was.  That's all I recall.",,
23399L,"Dream #1:  My next-door neighbor from my previous house--in the dream, I still lived there--had a party for his high school son.  Kids were everywhere and it was joyous. The maple leaves were green and still on the trees, making the light filter through them on his steep driveway.    While this celebration occurred and I was an onlooker, folks kept approaching me, telling me it was Wednesday and I always have a movie group with a woman whose name I no longer can recall.  I did not recognize her name, but I saw it as an opportunity to have an ""out"", should I be asked to join everyone later.      Dream #2:  When I need to get up, my dreams seem to become more stressful.  In this one, I had paid for a new apartment.  It still had an incredible water view, but it was quite grungy inside.    My mother's best friend, Sally Vietor, appeared in the unfurnished living room, with two dogs on a leash.  I saw her face before she saw mine.  She was repulsed by my living conditions.  I wanted to explain I was married to a sociopath, who hid all the money and I must start anew; but she started to talk about one of her dogs.  It had a combination ""normal"" shortish dog fur in off-white & gray; but then had dark chocolate tight waves on its tail, top of its head and neck.  It was soft to pet and quite the exquisite canine.  Why did I dream about the quality of dogs?    Well, in pops my horrific ex-husband and he moves a piece of bar top, revealing the refrigerator.  I never considered the refrigerator!  It was so tiny and never would fit my current fridge's contents.  I kept asking, ""How much are refrigerators now?""  He just shrugged and told me, ""Not my problem,"" exactly as he would IRL.  I was thinking I could break it somehow, then plead for a larger one.  Why did I not see that miniature appliance?  There was so much room in the kitchen for a normal one that would work!    The whole time, I kept trying to point out the view to everyone, as the saving grace of this slum world.  Yet each time I looked toward it, there was a glare that prevented me from glimpsing it; so I failed to mention it aloud.",,

I ran away and called the police and then remembered my child was still in the house. I didn't know what to do, hoped the man wasn't interested in me or my child and was just there to steal property.    Dream #2: I went to a really fancy restaurant for lunch during work. It was in a museum, very beautiful atmosphere. I went back home where I had two roommates, and I told them about the restaurant. They told me that one of their aunts came over to cook thanksgiving dinner, but that it wasn't very good and she aggressively pushed them to eat too much food.

There was a doctor there that my husband introduced us to as the doctor who had taken care of his brother for three lesions on his back.The doctor was in his fifties or sixties with a short white beard and glasses.

The house was full of small decorations. She showed me the second kitchen in the house, which really impressed me and I was thinking how I might like to buy the house because of the second kitchen.  Dream #3. My husband, one of my children and I were going to a Christmas party for my husband's coworkers.  I went back in the house to get something I forgot, and then had to use the bathroom.  I was concerned that my husband and child would get impatient waiting for me.  They came back into the house to look for me.

We forgot to clean and how to host, and the guests didn't really know what to do, and we were also trying to do a garage sale.    Dream 3: Husband and I were at a spa. Husband kept trying to get a hand job in a private area in the spa.  As soon as we got close to orgasm, someone would walk in.  We tried the pedicure room. All was going well, but then a woman with a teenage daughter with developmental delays walked in. The mom was trying to get the daughter a pedicure with blue polish. The daughter screamed and kicked the polish all over her toys and then kicked the pedicurist in the face, causing her to bite off the tip of her tongue.  She said it's OK, i'll get it 3d printed.

And then we were in this other big house with long grey hallways that was set aside especially for people counting the votes and there were small signs throughout the house that were labels for the different uses of each room. I was very proud of Sho, I was very proud of him for being a volunteer and doing his civic duty.    Dream 2 of 2-I was getting a Covid shot and there were all kinds of protocols I had to follow and this woman was asking me questions as a part of the test and she was speaking in a voice so quiet I had to keep asking her to repeat, plus she had a foreign accent and at the end I had to pack up everything so carefully in my rucksack and that woman I had been speaking to was sitting kind of behind a curtain though her face was mostly revealed, and when I opened my eyes (because it was so dark I had kept my eyes closed  for the interview with her) and when I opened my eyes she appeared to be a very nice nice person who smiled, but her voice when I couldn't see her face had not sounded very friendly at all, she had blonde wavy hair and a very kind face, I could see she was a kind person but she was being paid to conduct the interviews.",,

DREAM 2 OF 2: I was traveling, walking around in a new city, with my close friend Carol Kaufman and we were passing a performance, a play that was taking place on a big stairway outside in front of a big building with pillars and columns. We kept walking to see if it would be over when we came back in front of the building so we could go inside, and every time we passed by they were doing the same scene and we were trying to get inside this building so finally Carol sneaked up the stairs on one side past some actors and then I followed her and we slipped inside the door which was wooden and painted black.

We needed someone to sing 2 songs so I rode my bicycle to the nearby music department. It was crowded with young artist types and finally I was able to meet with the director and explain ed our needs, asking if he could help and for how much. We ended up across the street at this organic farm/open air restaurant and sat down to talk more. He seemed negative about our project and I revealed that we were also writing it and performing it and only had 4 weeks. He said ..unlikely we could do that.  I looked over and saw my boss and wondered if he heard since it was a surprise.  ",,
22869S,"Dream 1: I was at my front door organizing shoes and clothes in the closet. My next door neighbor, kept coming up to the door and serenading me and trying to seduce me. I wanted him to leave.   Dream 2: I was in a car with Steve and was trying to avoid the man from Dream 1. We got stopped by a police officer and a short man in regular clothes who told us to go a different way. Steve said no, I'm going to Brooklyn Heights, and the guy said oh (he thought Steve was going where he had come from). As we kept driving Steve said they had taught a course together. Then I was with my mom and we went into a food shop that was two doors down from the Dream 1 guy. I hoped he wouldn't see me. We went in to pick up mozzerella cheese and something else for lunch. She tried a bread sample at the counter and I realized we weren't wearing masks. I took a mask out from her backpack and put it on. I looked at the cheese case and all the cheeses were in bottles like orange juice. There was a message that popped up that said something like people were proud of my bravery against the Dream 1 guy. Then the message disappeared and I asked my mom which cheese we should get. There was a lot less cheese in the case as I looked at it. She said she had already got some. I realized she was sitting at the counter with our lunch eating. It looked very fancy with coffee in light blue cups and a nice spread of food. I said oh, I thought we were taking it to go and having it at home. I was worried about her eating indoors without a mask on. ",,
10764S,"Dream 1: I was going to an event with my best friend. At the event, I met my former supervisor and some other people I knew. My best friend went home some time before me and I were supposed to visit her a couple of hours later. I got a lift with my supervisor and other friends and were supposed to get out of the car somewhere along the way. However, the car never stopped so I had to just get off and run for an hour in order to get to my best friend's house.     Dream 2: I was in some random house and found myself in the middle of a foresome, all four of them were women and two of them were twins. (I'm gay in real life as well). I didn't dream the sexual act in itself- only the events leading up to it.",,
21268S,"Dream 1: I was in a small church and had a long white wedding dress on. There was music playing, either an organ player or a recording, and some chairs in a small, empty, wooden room. I looked around for people and could vaguely make out voices from far away but couldn't see anyone. I saw two chairs at the front and I knew they were for me and the person I was getting married to. I went downstairs to another similar room. There was an L.L. Bean sweater on a chair and I picked it up. I wondered if anyone would come in. I smelled it and put it back. I thought it must be the preacher's sweater, or vicar's, or whoever. I sat there in the dark, waiting. Then I realized I had been sitting there for quite some time but I couldn't remember how long or what had happened while I was sitting there. I gathered that people had come into the church in the meantime and were waiting for the wedding to begin. But when I went upstairs there was no one there. Maybe they had already left. I had a handful of change that I brought for some part of the wedding, and I hid it in the cushion of one of the chairs. At some point, my husband-to-be came in downstairs. There you are! I thought. Then his friend came in and his friend was in blackface. They hugged and the makeup came off onto my fiance's face. I was horrified. I took him aside and said who is this?? He can't be in blackface!!! And he said, he's from Palestine, it's different there. I tried to come up with an analogous example to make him see how stupid that was. I forget what I said but I said something like you wouldn't show up in shoes to a Japanese person's house, you would take them off because you're following THEIR customs. I left the church and got on a train. I realized I was in a different country. I saw many colorful birds from the window of the train, including a flock of pink flamingos. There were some birds I couldn't quite make out and I realized that I had forgotten to pack my binoculars. I got off the train and began walking in a crowd. Then I saw my fiance's face through the crowd. He had come looking for me. He had a big notebook or book with him. I asked him about it. It was his research on Lithuania that he was doing for graduate school. I said my ancestors are from there! I thought we knew nothing about each other but that we were getting married, and that we had so much time to get to know each other now.   Dream 2: I was in the same church. I had been married and was talking to Chris L. who was at the wedding. There were posters on the wall in the shape of coca-cola bottles, big ones, that were stuck to the wall with glue. They had been put up for the wedding. He tried taking them off but they were very sticky. I got up to try and at first they didn't budge but then they popped right off. I looked at the back of one and saw that it took a little bit of the wood from the wall with it. Chris said that's okay. We took down the rest and I realized they were all posters for Thailand tourism. Chris asked if I had ever been. Then later, Colin was telling a man and a woman that they were about to be married and that she would be ecstatic. Colin turned into Richard from Grey's Anatomy and was mispronouncing the word. He said ""esstatic."" He was kind of hypnotizing them. I wondered if that was what had happened to me before I got married, since I didn't know my husband and generally had no desire to be married. Richard told the man he was going to be very angry. He told the woman she would sit in the chair until her head exploded. ",,
26280S,"Dream 1: I was watching the end of a scary movie with mom but didn't know it was scary. The main character woman went to a man and she was guilty about something and he crushed her skull, whipping her body into the ground multiple times. I woke up scared.     Dream 2: I was living with mom and my brother and decided to go out for a quick walk. I didn't bring my mask. I then decided to just walk downtown and get an ice cream. I went into a food court with a few soft serve places and it was pretty crowded and people weren't wearing masks which made me anxious. A couple of the soft serve places looked closed but had open signs. Then I saw someone behind the glass. The stands had glass up with the flavors written on them. I went to one with Japanese flavors like red bean. I wanted cantaloupe and didn't see it listed initially, but when I looked closer I saw it and saw that the corner of the card was folded over so it was hard to see. I saw jazz and Chris and got nervous to see Chris. I asked him what flavor I should get, red bean or cantaloupe. Then I said I've already made up my mind, I want cantaloupe. So I went up to order and felt weird about not having a mask, but no one else had a mask either so at least I wasn't the odd one out. I asked the person behind the counter if they had a preference between red bean and cantaloupe. She said that the prices were really different because of covid. I asked what the prices were. She said because covid affected produce distribution, the cantaloupe flavor was $9.99 and red bean was the regular price. I considered for a second getting cantaloupe because I really wanted it but decided it was too much and ordered the red bean flavor. They gave it to me but there was something wrong with it. I can't remember but maybe it was melted. I gave it back and they said they would make me a new one. Then all of a sudden the food court became a vigil for a victim of police violence and I felt awkward about walking up to get my ice cream. There were people lining up to speak at microphones and the middle of the food court was made of long church pews. Chanel was there and she got up to be one of the first people to speak. I saw all the food stalls shut down and the people at the ice cream place doing paperwork. I went up to them and said I was waiting on an ice cream but I was wondering if I could just get a refund. The girl who had been at a desk/counter writing handed me a check and said yes here's your refund. Oh thank you I said. I realized she had anticipated giving me a refund and had been writing me a check when I saw her writing at the counter earlier. I saw that robin was speaking and I was surprised to see him there. I can't remember what he said. I waited for Chanel to be done and then went outside. She came out and at that moment Dakota drove up on his motorcycle and she got on the back. I felt disheartened because I had waited for her and now she was leaving with someone else. They seemed happy to see each other despite having broken up recently. But then as I walked away they drove up behind me and I said hi, and they slowed down for me but then I began to run to be able to keep a good pace with them. Chanel and I talked about robin and she told me that he was now a police officer. I was surprised to hear that and felt disgusted by him. I looked up at the stars and saw pictures in them. ",,
10265L,"Dream 1: Sarah told me she dreamed she gave me a ring and then found the ring, maybe in her pocket. She gave it to me. It was made with gold wire wrapped around with little jewels. It looked very old yet unworn . There was a little bit of wire at the bottom you were supposed to use to secure the ring and it stood straight out like it had never been used. It was perfect, exactly the kind of ring I had been looking for. Because Sarah had given it to me in her dream, I felt entitled to it. It was mine. I put it on my ring finger and it looked very nice but it was a little loose. I put it on my other fingers and they were all a little loose. I was walking down a hallway as I did this and was showing two tall men I knew (I forget who they were now -- maybe one of them was Sam D?).     Dream 2: My roommates and I were getting ready to go out somewhere. It was a beautiful hot summer day. They were all going to take the subway and I thought I would bike there since it was so nice out. I really felt like biking. I thought I should put on a tank top because it was hot out. I told my roommates I would meet them there. When I got to the bottom of the stairs ready to leave I looked down and saw that I was wearing my pink and white striped long-sleeved shirt. What! I thought. I forgot to put on a tank top! ",,
8369L,"Dream 1: Shelby and I were in the upstairs dining room and went out to our very unused balcony. It was really nice out there if a little unstable feeling. I crouched down and could see through the window squirrels napping en masse in the leafy tree branches. I told Shelby to come over to where I was so that she could see too. We could see squirrels yawning and rolling over. Later, there were a few people at the house to look at it to rent, and we showed them the balcony. This time it was more like a big room.¬† Jac and I went in and took our shirts off towards the moonlight streaming in the window and lay down.¬†    Dream 2: I was in a building hallway when Chloe Sevigny walked out of a room with someone else. She had a small pig on a leash, and the pig was covered in silky deep turquoise blue hair. Without saying hi to or looking at Chloe, I said hello to the pig who stood up on its hind legs, very happy to receive attention. I was aware that Chloe and the person she was with were watching me, but I still didn't look at them. I said, ""she's soooooo soft,"" which the pig was. Then I left and they went to go talk to someone else. The woman who was with Chloe came over to me and said, ""you're taking over for me now,"" meaning I was assigned to show Chloe around. I was taken aback and felt a little embarrassed; if I had known I would be working with her today I would have said hello and been more hospitable when I was petting her pig. I walked up to Chloe and was very friendly and she didn't seem bothered at all that I had ignored her earlier. We walked over to an event where we were supposed to be given disguises so that people wouldn't stare at us. I¬†already looked different than usual, with dark blue hair and different makeup. We opened the doors to a large room full of young people. They all clapped when we entered. It was a university class and their assignment was to give us disguises. But first the instructor had them do a different activity, which I forget, but it ended up taking a very long time. I looked at the time and realized we had to be going to our next event. I whispered to Chloe that we should leave and she said ok. We started sneaking out quietly and then the instructor thanked us and everyone said bye. I thought oh well, I suppose we don't really need the disguises. Our next event was outdoors on a structure like a bridge or a treehouse. There was a group of people there. There were one or two people there who I had met before but they didn't seem to recognize me. Everyone seemed very happy to see both of us and to enjoy our company. At the end of the event, I said to one woman, ""it was nice to see you,"" but she didn't seem to be aware that we had met before. I realized that my new look was more of a disguise than I thought. After we left I asked Chloe what she wanted for dinner. I listed some options including gourmet pizza, which I had the menu for. The menu was paper and very old but in good condition, like it had been kept pressed in a book. I said, showing her the menu, they have pizza, calzones, and then they have a bunch of Armenian food like dolma and lamejun. She said ok let's go there. When we got there we ordered soup. As we were eating the soup I noticed something bright blue in the soup, and then realized that the soup was full of little bits of blue melted plastic. It looked like parts of a Tupperware lid. I called the owner over who I thought was going to be mad, but she was very nice and asked us what pizza we wanted instead. Chloe ordered a tuna anchovy pizza and I ordered the Greek pizza. By this point Chloe may have turned into grimes.¬†",,
14782S,"Dream 1: Steve had no school for the rest of the semester because he had gone in and done a gym day. Other teachers had to go in for the rest of the term if they decided to do the gym day on the last day of school. Steve came over and we walked to my room. We passed a room that my roommates were in. They were all watching Jeopardy, but it was hosted by RuPaul. Then Miss Vanjie appeared and did this presentation thing where she floated on the air and lay sideways. She looked like a cherub and was tiny.     Dream 2: I was on a bus, like a greyhound. Potty Mouth was on the bus, or maybe just Abby. Karisa was showing Abby a cat I had drawn for her in her planner. I think I had drawn Potty Mouth too, and Abby referenced my drawing of Ally. When we were getting off the bus, everyone went ahead of me and it was just me and the person I took a teaching workshop with left on the bus. He asked if I wanted kettle chips and turned into Karisa. We stayed on the bus too long and the doors closed and it kept going. Oh no, I thought, then I remembered that the next stop was just the underground part of Harvard Square and I could just go up and meet everyone outside.     Dream 3: I was at the Brandeis museum. One exhibit was of water and a voice told me that if you looked into the water and smiled, the dolphins would come up and say hello. They would know you were there because of your shadow. I looked in the water and smiled, but it was full of clothes. As I looked in the clothes swirled, going in one direction, and I couldn't see anything in the water. The water was just a small tank in the art gallery. I saw Riley standing behind me talking to other people and I got nervous. I was eating a plate of sauteed rapini which I had a hard time eating. There was someone else I knew there too, but I forget who.    Dream 4: I was in Steve's backyard. Mike's house was just behind his instead of next to it. We could see Mike's son and his friend behind Mike's house putting their ears to the wall below a window. They were listening and laughing. I thought they were listening to Mike using the bathroom. I didn't want them to see me and I was grumpy. I climbed into Steve's bed, which was outside in his backyard.     Dream 5: I was in a wheelchair racing through a bike lane in Amsterdam. I wondered for a second whether I should be there or in the street, but thought that would be horrible if people in wheelchairs were made to share lanes with cars. The brakes were at my feet and I had trouble pressing them and thought I had little control, but every time I had to stop I stopped exactly where and when I wanted to. I was biking with Steve and someone else. We kept going into a hallway and stopped at a huge painted wooden door. We opened the door and went in. It was an art gallery. I brought my bike in. I was going to lock it in front of the gallery by the ticket window, but a woman coming out of the gallery warned me that it might get moved. I remembered that the last time I came here, I had brought my bike, but it was my other bike that was very small and lightweight and I was able to bring it with me. I looked around and saw a door that said Exit. I told Steve I would  go lock up my bike. He and Marcel were buying tickets. I opened the door and there was a steep staircase. I hoisted the bike to my shoulder and started going up. I realized that I was carrying it wrong and getting bike grease all over my shoulder. Then the stairs got even steeper and I had to cling to the bike and the railing and really pull myself up. I think I got to the top. ",,

Outside the 2nd story room I was in (which is also the kids bathroom at my parents house, but also not) there is a gigantic lemon tree. With the texts Adrian sends he also sends an image of a Pacman game that he moves forward one by one with each text. I realize I've been ignoring that, and move pieces forward myself. However, I'm unsure about this as Pack Man is typically a one player game.. and I'm not sure if I'm playing it right. As I move the final ghost forward I notice an NPC is also in the game somehow walking around. I don't interact with them and close out of the screen. In doing all this im only giving him half my attention and he is suspicious about this, and asks if I'm still there and listening to him. We change the topic to how my hair is short when I see him (somehow I think we meant my facial hair.

Plot twist: I had planned this holiday ages ago when I was with my now ex-longterm partner, so he also turned up to where we were staying because he wasn't going to cancel the holiday plans just because we weren't together. He arrived from the airport when my fiance was taking a nap. He barely spoke to me but was adamant that he had every right to be there (even though he didn't know the host, only through me).  I then went to a concert and my fiance went into the city. The concert ended really early, at like 6pm (because it was at DisneyWorld??), so I came home early but then was annoyed that my fiance was out. I went out to buy bread with the host and when we walked back I learnt that the area had very strict jaywalking rules and I may have been caught on camera walking outside of a designated line (the rules were more complicated that standard jaywalking rules).

We seemed to be waiting to be allowed to go. Again. people were happy. This seemed similar to the Japanese movie we watched last night, The Hidden Fortress, in the sense that we were trying to get past a border. I had a backpack on that someone admired and he picked me up by the top of the backpack way above the crowd. He seemed embarrassed after and I felt awkward.  A lot of people were in costume, like Mardi Gras, and I decided to dress also, but it was the next day and the crowds were more somber and without costumes in the street. I felt awkward.  We were waiting in a large restaurant, waiting till we could proceed wherever we were going, and a woman I was with didn't think she was ever going to get the beer she ordered. I tried to calm her explaining that the staff is overwhelmed.   4. A diplomat was being urgently sent to Washington. He asked me to deliver some papers here.

10747S,"Earlier sleep:   ""My search tells me that maybe four people in the world could have manifested the candidate days and times.""     Immersed disembodied perspective: like watching a show from within VR space. The statement was uttered by a woman being interviewed about a hospital. In the mid-twentieth century it had become the first place able to operate on lung cancer. Before that, lung cancer had been treatable only by completely removing the lungs, which handily resolved the cancer but created certain inconveniences for the patient. The first challenge had been learning to detect the cancer in time. Then the hospital was retrofitted with a sort of van from 1902: it was embarrassingly old-fashioned but somehow essential to the new process.     Earlier had been a scene in which a blonde woman with short hair left the place while pushing a wheeled conveyance like a laundry cart. She hadn't gotten far from the colleagues she had just said goodbye to when a pale middle-aged man (resembling a younger Chris Matthews) popped his head out of the cart, commenting that he felt stifled. He was wearing a bright red bandana on his head. [Day Residue: Yesterday saw a facemask for sale made from a bright red Western-style bandana. A few days ago, read an article about Chris Matthews apologizing.] As a viewer, I was annoyed that the character was jeopardizing his own escape by losing patience and revealing himself-the woman was trying to smuggle him out of the facility. [DR: Watching Clone Wars last night, annoyed by the similarly impulsive and self-sabotaging behavior of one of the Martez sisters.] The woman was putting herself at risk to help him escape, at no benefit to herself, but his behavior and attitude suggested that he took her help for granted and did not appreciate it. [DR: Last night just before bed read the Alexandra Petri article in the Washington Times satirizing our lack of appreciation of the ""heroes"" working essential jobs: https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/04/30/heroes-we-cannot-possibly-repay-you-your-sacrifice-so-we-will-make-no-effort/]    Last sleep:   My character-a woman but not me, younger, mixed race, with a lavender shoulder-length bob haircut-was an aspiring but so far unsuccessful Shakespearean actor. To date she had only played bit parts with no lines. I was in a large arena-like space where parts were being assigned, and as I waited in line chatting with people I noticed the delightful habit of Shakespeareans to produce an apt line of dialogue for everything that comes up in conversation.     When I got to the front of the line, I started flirting with the woman sitting behind the cheap folding table, before realizing that she was a casting agent. Then I was embarrassed that she might have thought I was flirting with her just to get a better role. And what if I did get cast in a good role? I didn't know any roles by heart, like the more experienced actors, and I was mortified by the thought of being asked to try out for a role and realizing I didn't know any of the lines. At this point, my mind broke character briefly to resolve that if this should happen, I would make sure things worked out somehow.     As my character mingled with the others, one man caught her attention. He was unusually short, and the shape of his shoulders suggested he was even a little hunchbacked, but he had a very dignified appearance, and was apparently very well respected, because the other actors were crowding around to give him things, such as fake swords and other props from their performances.     There were several rows of folding chairs arranged on one side of the arena where the actors were trying out for speaking roles. As my character sat there, two or three rows back, she began to realize that someone was trying to kill her. In front of her and across the makeshift aisle to the right, two men stood up and faced her with cameras, setting off their flashes alternately in a kind of pattern that seemed designed to create a neurological overload. But my character had the wits to forestall this by alternately blinking her eyes for as long as the flashes persisted, and as soon as the assault stopped, she got up to make her escape.    As she made her way past the people in line, she ran into the short man again. He was also on the verge of leaving, and on learning of her predicament, he offered to give her a ride-he said he was parked nearby. As soon as they left the building, he pointed to his VW bug in the parking lot, and they hurried over. All the props people had given him were on the ground behind it, and my character was tempted to save the items by loading them into the trunk, but there was no time, and the man didn't seem to care about leaving them behind.     As they drove off, she had to lean forward and cover her head in black cloth so that she wouldn't be spotted in the passenger seat. She quipped that she should carry a variety of wigs so that she could more easily change her appearance on the fly.     They drove for a while through a beautiful, surreal, country landscape. Then the man offered to take her home, and she was embarrassed because she had assumed they were going to his house, something she realized she was actually looking forward to. She covered for her embarrassment by pretending it was because they had already missed the turn that would have taken them to her house (which was true), and she had forgotten to say something at the time. She also was embarrassed to admit that she lived in a slovenly apartment in a bad neighborhood of the city, when she knew that he probably lived in a really nice house in the country. But she summoned the courage to confess her interest in him, at which he appeared visibly moved and surprised.   ",,

22667L,"Early in the dream I was with my husband. We were being pursued, so we had closed off the area. On my laptop I saw some objects being sensed, but I was afraid we had initiated the next event too soon. I reminded myself that this game was probably structured in such a way that we wouldn't be able to accidentally miss content.     We had a large boring device of the type used to dig tunnels, which we turned on, and then followed through the tunnel that it made. I was worried about the cats, afraid they had gone ahead, and might be harmed by the borer. My husband had a cat carrier, but only three second-rate cats were in it, not our favorite cats. [We only have 2 cats in WL, but in the dream they were apparently numerous.]    The tunnel turned into a sort of hallway, but the building was only semi-enclosed, sort of like a stable. I saw a woman up ahead on the right, near one of the stall doors, and was worried at first about being seen, since she might recognize that we didn't belong here. But then I heard a second woman inside the stall say something about a cat who was bleeding. I was afraid it was one of mine, and that it had been hurt by the borer, as I had feared, so I boldly stepped inside. But I saw the woman tending a small kitten that I didn't recognize. The kitten had a tiny wound on its paw. I offered to help, and tried to pinch the wound closed for long enough until the blood could coagulate.     When this event had concluded, I returned to the hallway and continued to walk forward. Around this time, I was no longer accompanied by JP, but by my mom and brother, although I did not notice any change. When we passed out of the stable, we were on a paved walkway through what looked like a wealthy plantation district. The grounds were all landscaped and manicured, and there were long white manor houses.     I knew that this was a parallel world from the one in which the dream had started, but I did not know its nature. Where were we? From the surroundings, I would have guessed the American South, but did that have meaning here? As we walked along, I looked for a place where we could get off the path and be screened from view, so that we could talk. Finally I found a suitable area.     I insisted to the others that we had to be careful until we could find out more. If we met someone who asked where we were from, what could we say? We didn't even know if this world had the same landmasses, much less the same place names. But we needed some way to answer, and it would help if we all had the same story. I thought it over, and decided that the best approach would be to say, upon inquiry, that we were from ""up north."" If this was the American South, it would make sense to them, and even if it wasn't, well, it was vague enough that it could still scan.     ""If they press us for a place name, we can say we're from Canada,"" I continued. If this world mapped on to ours, this would again make perfect sense. And if it didn't, we could just say it is a small village up north.     I was startled to realize that a local guy had come up behind me while I was talking, and shot dirty glances at the others for not alerting me. How much had he heard? But I realized I needed to play it cool, so when I turned around, I greeted him casually, with the air of a tourist.     ""Is there a bookstore in town?"" I asked him. I thought a bookstore would be our best bet for getting information about this place without asking too many suspicious questions.     ""No,"" replied the young man. From where we were standing, I could see what looked like a main street of the town downhill some ways off, and could clearly make out a building labeled ""LIBRARY.""     ""What about that library?"" I asked, pointing toward it. ""Is it open to the public?""     The man seemed embarrassed and confused by my interest in the library, and didn't give me a straight answer. I thought my question hadn't been clear, so I tried to clarify.    ""I mean, is it a private collection or would I be able to check out books?""    ""Why would you want to go in there?"" he asked with disgust.     I could sense that something was off about our communications, but I wasn't quite sure yet what it was. I was starting to suspect that we were using the same words with very different meanings. I decided that continuing to talk to him would only make things worse, so I excused myself as politely and firmly as I could, and headed toward the town with my mom and brother.     When we were only a few hundred yards from the library, I had them wait on a hillside while I went in to investigate. The library was a plain white clapboard building. Upon entering, I was initially struck by the singular lack of books. In fact, there wasn't much in the room at all, except... a kind of wooden truss with manacles attached. Quickly I realized that despite the plain, almost Protestant exterior and interior, this was unmistakably a sex dungeon. Luckily no one was around, so I quickly left and reported back to the others. In this world, it seemed, the word ""library"" had a very different meaning. At least that explained the weird reaction of the man when I had asked about it.     We started walking down the street to look around, and had only passed a couple more buildings to the left of the ""library"" when I saw a small, unlabeled storefront with dusty windows through which I could see books. A bookstore! Probably they called this something else too, which was why the man had not understood when I had asked about it. I looked around the door to see if there was a sign, but the only writing I could find indicated the name of the proprietor, Mr. Cratchett.     ""Mr. Cratchett, that's a good sign,"" I mused aloud, remembering the name of the amiable employee from the Dickens story in my world (though I see that it is actually spelled ""Cratchit"" in WL... I think I've always visualized it wrong in my head, having heard the name spoken far more than I've seen it written.)    I knocked on the door and a thin middle-aged man opened it. ""Bug off! Bug off!"" he said pleasantly, and I realized that this was what people in this world said to be welcoming. I was pleased that I was starting to get the hang of how language worked here, though I didn't perceive the principles underlying the substitutions.     As I browsed his shelves, I saw an English-Thai dictionary with a familiar binding, and realized it must be the analog of one I had in my own world. [Though it was actually modeled on a Thai-Thai dictionary I have in WL.] At first I was excited: a dictionary might be really useful! But I realized that an English-Thai dictionary might only compound my confusion, because what if the Thai words were undergoing the same kind of substitutions as the English ones? It seemed likely. I decided I'd be better off with a regular English-English dictionary, so kept browsing. I refrained from asking the proprietor, because who knows what the word ""dictionary"" might mean around here, or what a dictionary would actually be called?    Then I found a book that looked immensely useful. It wasn't a dictionary as such, but had a lot of illustrations labeled with short text captions. This would be perfect! And as I was browsing through the pages, I saw an image that suddenly explained something that had been confusing me. The proprietor of the shop had been going on about some sort of invisible mice that lived on our caps and needed to be fed, and I had just assumed this was a product of the weird language barrier, but the book had pictures and diagrams and explanations of these mice! They were real after all! Unlike ordinary visible mice, which needed ordinary real food, these invisible mice could eat much more efficiently, and would be sated by a diet of abstract ideas and concepts. I had found it hard to believe there was an invisible mouse living on my cap in this world, but after reading all about it in the book, it was starting to make sense.     I looked inside the front cover, and saw that the book cost $11. There were previous crossed-out notations showing that it had been marked down from $20 and originally $30. $11 seemed perfectly reasonable, and I was willing to pay it, but I realized I didn't actually have any money in this world. I returned the book to the shelf and made a mental note to come back for it when I figured out how to get some cash. I didn't think anyone else was likely to buy it in the meantime: it was basically a kid's book, the information being far too basic for any adult who actually inhabited this world. And the markdowns suggested it had been sitting here for a long time.   ",,

22312L,"Extremely detailed and elaborate dreams. When I woke up at noon, knowing that a new round was starting today, I stayed in bed to review and try to retain my dreams. At some point I realize that I am sleeping and that I am in the middle of a new dream and have lost what I was originally trying to recall. I decide to continue in these new dreams. I have maybe only had the realization that I was in in a dream and not wake a few times before in my life. We have also traveled a lot. Been in many international airports and foreign hotels. Know what it's like to scramble for  a flight  On Saturday night we zoom chatted with Canadian friends and joked about the utter pre Covid, pre 9/11 craziness we had experienced  of the international terminal in Toronto. Also we watched many movies in the past week with foreign hotel rooms and also was sorting thru travel photos. Last in Europe in 2017 for 4 weeks.  1. My husband and I are staying at a hotel. I get to the room alone. It's an older building and because of the bathroom, especially the tub set up, I am thinking it's European. The room is more like a suite because there are 2 rooms. The entry room has an unenclosed large square tub.  The doorway across from the tub leads into a very large, bright room with a king sized bed and another, even larger tub. There are several tall, clear glass decanter style bottle filled with, what I wrongly assume is bubble bath. I decide to take a bath and empty one decanter into the tub and get in. Because of the texture of the water, I realize the bottle had been filled with vichyssoise. I have a ladle and am trying to drain the water out of the tub while scooping what I can of the soup back into the bottle. I know I am going to have to shower off after I clean up the mess I'm the tub but would like to wash off first.  Another woman, someone I am acquainted with, comes in and, I, embarrassed, try to explain the situation. I am suggesting that she should use the other tub because I am guessing it may have one of those European hand held shower heads. That one is meant to sit down in the tub to shower. I also note a smaller, clear glass bottle with a white substance in it on the smaller tubs edge and am pretty sure that is the real soap or bubble bath. My husband eventually shows up. There is talk about the person (and maybe her spouse) sharing the room with us. There seems to be a problem. There is talk about getting a rollaway and there is a couch. Looking closer at the entry way room, i am thinking there must be a fridge because why put an unrefrigerated bottle of soup in the room. I see a kithenette area in a space by the hallway door. I hadn't noticed it because the door blocked it when I entered and there wasn't a light on. The rooms details are quite elaborate, even down to the wallpaper design.  2. We go into a female acquaintance's room.   Someplace she is going to be living in for awhile. Almost an efficiency but large. I am imagining how the place could be configured to meet her needs. Along the top of one wall, there is a panel of bright, but deeply colored glass vertical rectangles. Reds, deep yellow, orange, blue, green. Covering a stretch of about 9 feet. Below that is an alcove space with what appears to be a rod with lots of strange hooks on it. Perhaps for those wooden hangars, like in some hotels. I assume it's meant to be an open closet. It's strange but I act positive about it, saying that it's good sized and she won't have to struggle with where to put her clothes. Again, the rooms look European to me.  3. I am at a large, European (I think) airport. I am talking to some people. We all are trying to get on flights, not necessarily to the same places. The airport has 2 large buildings and I am saying that one has to watch out for the time of the flight because it can be impossible to get to a flight leaving from the other terminal. The people I am talking to don't seem to be familiar with the airport or how it all works. I tell them that it's happened to me and the people booking the flights for passengers seem oblivious to that detail. I am attempting to book a flight but I know I can't make it to the gate at the time that's being offered to me. The airport is crowded and I think it's going to take a lot of effort to get a flight, if I can even get one. Again, I am thinking this is European or even Toronto. Again, a lot of details about clothing, the ticket desk, building fixtures, etc.",,

Robin said something like ""dude I love exploring"" and that he had taken a walk somewhere. Then he said ""I got too distracted by all the visuals so I closed my eyes and let my nose guide me."" The young guy sitting with us was really impressed and said aw really, wow, and it was some kind of established psychogeographic wandering method to explore with your nose. I said ""I've ended up in front of the same cafe twice in Little Italy!"" and everyone concurred that Little Italy was so nice. Robin said, ""guess where I ended up? At xxxx"" and said some word that I didn't know. It was a dish I hadn't heard of before. The guy with us was very excited. Robin said ""guess what I got to bring back with me. A whole sack of raw corn."" He was very excited. I said, ""I hope it doesn't get confiscated."" He said ""what do you mean?"" and I said well you're not supposed to bring plant materials across the border. Robin didn't seem aware. I said, ""well, I travel a lot and you'll probably be fine; they rarely even ask. Just on the off chance they do check, you won't have your corn. Because the US is really strict about that kind of stuff."" Then we were all walking somewhere and passed a little park or wilderness area. We stopped and watched the birds. There were two big birds on the ground and as I got closer I realized they were two bald eagles! I pointed them out to the person I was with and they said wow. Robin was on his phone, with his face down, and didn't notice. ""Robin,"" we said, ""look, bald eagles!"" But as I got closer and closer I realized that they were not bald eagles. They had white heads and brown bodies but they were in the shape of a goose.

5930L,First dream: I was walking in the forest and found baby morel mushrooms!  So exciting.    Second dream: I was at the airport with my daughter. I had surprised her with a week in Paris for her 10th birthday. We were boarding and I realized how unprepared we were. I hadn't secured a kid sized mask. I wasn't sure if I had made housing reservations or even packed. She was so tired on the plane. I deboarded and left her on the plane sleeping. I only realized I left her asleep on the plane once I was off the jet bridge and couldn't get back on.,,

They mentioned that I was probably color blind. Then a senior messaged me via twitter DM. It turns out it was a ""twitter game"" about sharing pictures of beanies you have given as gifts.

8122S,"First I had a bad-ish dream about one of my dad's friends. I forget what happened, but I think he's on my mind since he was recently diagnosed with prostate cancer. I had another dream that I was at a festival full of shops selling little frothy drops of microbes and yeast. I was there with someone, who got ahold of an illegal strain and we were able to check out from the festival and leave with it. He was excited to show me what it tastes like.  Yeast munrobio festuvaal get rare one to eat. In another dream, I was part of a coordinated heist stealing who knows what from a large elaborate garden party.    Finally, I had a dream that I was constructing a mini sunrise scene for my little brother made from random things like an egg made from spun sugar, Lego pieces, and colorful marshmallow discs. I was at my family's home. They arrived home early and my project wasn't done yet, but my brother didn't mind. My dad and mom were in the kitchen and accidentally broke my sugar egg; they apologized but I didn't mind. I helped them sweep the pieces off the floor and rug. They gave me an alcoholic drink and laughed and told me not to be shy about having as much as I wanted. For some reason, at the end of this dream William James was living at the house and was in hiding (Yes, the psychology related guy. I have no idea why he was there, he's not even one of my favorite historical figures). He had to keep his name secret, as well as the name of a child that was staying at the house with him. He was scolding the child for using his real name, saying that their aliases, not themselves were safe where they are.",,

During that time we didn't stop moving and we came across /or heard the voices of some friends in common. We ended up in a restaurant with a beautiful view of Paris but the weather was really weird, sometimes sonny with a blue sky and few seconds later a lot of fog with a grey sky, and back forward to the sun. There was a lot of noise in the restaurant, too much for me, but I was still trying to explain myself to this person, so I yelled because we were not sitting side by side. I still have this feeling that I have to keep moving to be able to make a connection with her but I have a really hard time concentrate because of all the noise and the people around me.

Second part was about the house (where my parents are quarantined now), that I am there, walking around with some strange but very proud bird. ",,
11952L,"First sleep:     I was in Bangkok, in a windowless room that opened into an enclosed mall. It was a wide room that accommodated about 6-8 rows of chairs arranged neatly on two sides of a central aisle, with other aisles around the outside. One could sit in the chairs to watch a Buddhist service taking place in the front of the room. I wondered what kind of service it was, because it was very atypical of Theravada Buddhism to have the audience sit in chairs in a commercial space like this, and the monks were wearing simple black robes. Had I seen Japanese monks in such robes? It was definitely something Mahayana. But Bangkok is getting more diverse all the time, so Mahayana practices are not unknown. I sat on the right, maybe in the second row about three seats in (this is my best guess and not an exact recollection of my position). There were other audience members seated around me, so the chairs were at maybe 35-50% capacity.     Suddenly I realized... wasn't I forgetting something? Oh yeah, COVID-19 was still in play! And here I was sitting in an enclosed room full of people, and none of us were wearing masks! I knew Bangkok hadn't been that badly hit, and that not just proximity but length of exposure was a probable factor... how long had I been sitting there? I reckoned it had been about half an hour. That wasn't too bad, but probably this would be a good time to leave, just in case. I got up and walked out into the main mall area.     Just before waking:     I was looking at the full-page ad on the back of a magazine cover for ""Haunted Plum Mead."" This was becoming a popular drink, so through common use, the word was already contracting: now people said it like ""Haunted Plummead,"" but it was still formally written with the space.    The ad showed a tall glass bottle poised to pour its contents into a glass, and there was a ghostly image of the same bottle behind it, and maybe some plums in the background. As I looked, the images began to move: the plums and the ghostly image merged into the real bottle, which also became white and glowing, as the liquid began to pour into the glass.   ",,
9550S,"First sleep:   A game-like dream. At one point I come across several large contraptions (about 12 feet tall) designed to shoot lasers. Though somewhat adjustable, it annoys me that their basic orientation is facing one another. At first I assume they were installed this way as a dumb mistake, but then I realize that it might be the point.     While sitting in the back of a cab (I am next to the left window, and a vague female companion is in the back seat on the right), I test my hypothesis by operating a console that makes two of the lasers direct each their beams directly into the aperture of the other. They quickly heat up, and when I think they are on the verge of exploding I tell the cabdriver to back up quickly.     We avoid the worst of the explosion, but my companion is hurt. I find a cemetary and give her a healing pack that is the size of a ramen noodle package but appears to be made of tightly packed mung bean sprouts. I had been improvising with the lasers, but I start to understand that this is the nature of the game, a series of encounters we must attempt to survive.     Last sleep:   I'm on a plane. It was supposed to be an eight hour trip, but I was delayed for five hours. We've finally arrived at the airport and people are getting off. (Oddly, the exit is on the front right side of the cabin, as though it were a bus. The pilot is also located in the front left like a bus driver.) With the long delay I know I've already missed dinner, and fortunately realize I'm not hungry, but I'm still eager to get off the plane and check into my hotel so I can rest.     I'm trying to get my stuff together so I can join the people deplaning, but a bunch of stuff has fallen out of my backpack, so I am delayed in the aisle as I scramble to pick all my things off the floor and shove them in my bag. By the time I am ready to leave, all the others have gotten off (apart from about four other people who show no sign that they intend to leave-maybe they are continuing another leg of the flight?) and the pilot has shut the door.     The pilot says he can't let me off now, and he has to go somewhere and wait for another hour. He starts taxiing the plane alongside the airport. I become upset and plead with him: ""Oh my god, I've been on this plane for thirteen hours, please just let me off!""   ",,
7894S,"First sleep:   My brother and I were playing a game, like tag but with a twist. We were in an open floor-plan house, and I bet that if he put on a blindfold, he would not be able to locate me by sound alone. He bet that he could. As soon as he put on the blindfold, I levitated up near the ceiling and watched him groping around. It felt a bit like cheating, but I reasoned that the rules did not expressly forbid levitation. And I still had to be a *little* careful, because the ceiling was low enough that he might accidentally find me by reaching up, if I did not take care to stay out of the way.     After doing this for a while I felt the call of nature and yelled from the bathroom, ""Time out! I have to pee."" When I came back out, I noticed he was being threatened by the Tyrannasaurus Rex in the pen at the front of the house. There was no time for a better solution, so I tossed him the skirt I'd been wearing and he threw it at the T-Rex to distract it.     This was taking place in a house and yard unlike any from waking life, but earlier in the dream (or a different one), I had been outside in the yard of our old farm. There were maze-like passages and military-style shelters in the field, abandoned now, but I was intrigued by the animals I saw there, foxes and feral dogs. I tried to pet one of the dogs roaming the military bunker area, but it snapped at my hand and I realized it was no longer socialized.      Later:   I had just finished interviewing four men and women in their early twenties, recent college graduates.     ""The thing is,"" I commented at one point, ""people used to live more or less the same kind of life, whether they were old or young. Now people live radically different kinds of lives based on their-"" I paused, trying to remember the word I needed.    ""Demographic?"" suggested one of the young people.    I nodded. That was it. ""Demographic.""     Later:   Driving through an Asian city, with tall modern buildings, possibly in China. I had just learned about a new trend, in which Chinese families would take a picture together with the family car suspended upside down from the ceiling of their apartment. I was curious how they managed to get the car in that position, and someone explained it to me. First the vehicle was hoisted up using pullies, then large balloons were inflated in such a way as to rotate the suspended vehicle.     As we drove through the city, my brother at the wheel, we were not going along roads at ground level, but bouncing across a series of white platforms on the rooftops. As the car landed on each of the platforms, it would be launched toward the next one. Sometimes it seemed like we were about to miss, but then we would land safetly, and at one point only the front wheels made contact with the platform, so I thought we might fall, but the technology was sufficient to pull the car fully onto the platform from this partial contact.     Later:   In a city I take to be Chicago, in what I take to be the vicinity of the AIC (though there is no resemblance to WL). As I pass by other pedestrians, I notice that some are wearing masks, and some aren't, and suddenly realize that I am not wearing one, and ought to be. I am carrying two Cheerios boxes, so I hold them up to partially block my face.     Later:   Still in Chicago, but now I am a Chinese woman, perhaps in her early thirties, and a new mother. I drop into a little shop where an older Chinese woman makes hand-sewn garments. I am admiring a bright blue silk jacket with wool padding, and try it on. It is a bit too large, but there are no smaller sizes except one sized for an infant, and I decide the large size is very comfortable after all. It costs 189 yuan, which is more than I would normally spend, but I received a gift of 500 yuan on the birth of the baby, so I decide to splurge.   ",,
6658S,"First sleep: The dream involved jumping puzzles modeled by Mass Effect: Andromeda. Like the game, you could target something with the ""E"" button, but you had to hold it down until the circle around it completed. [Day residue: Played ME:A last night and encountered a jumping puzzle that I couldn't solve until I watched someone do it on Youtube.] Details hazy, but tall trees were involved, and spiders, and the environment had a fantasy feel reminiscent of LOTR.     Second sleep: An elaborate plot that also felt game-related, details hazy. There were also scenes related to cooking, included a cold pizza that I was irritated about. [Day residue: Got pizza last night, and even though I arrived long before it was done, by the time they called my name I could tell the pizza had been sitting for a few minutes and cooled off slightly, so I was irritated by a similar incident in WL.]   ",,

I spoke with him briefly about his niece (True story, his niece is a former student of mine, and she made a zombie movie about viruses for my class and he was featured in it!).

8223S,"First was a nightmare about a disease people were experiencing where we would look in a mirror and you would be fine as long as the image was not yourself, once the image was yourself reflected then you knew you got the disease. When I saw my image I felt a sharp pain in my belly and I woke up. I had to pee and it was fullest I'd ever felt by bladder be.  Back to bed- next dream is I'm a prison guard  in a foreign country maybe Cambodia or Laos - two men have decided to lash out at each other with cutlasses and they're throwing chops at each other and ones arm is about to fall off and the other had part of his face sliced off. I was freaking out because I wasn't sure how I was supposed to stop this situation, I'm 5'1. I woke up. It was 4am. Again I had to pee. Back to sleep. The next dream is camping in some beautiful place with kind loving people. I was unknown but there were people who started popping up claiming to know me or have known me. It felt strange and uneasy but I was Graceful about it. I just kept moving and walking. Apparently something was happening and people were trying to rescue me. Eventually for the second or third time the husband of my ex boss asked if I needed help getting out, and I said no thanks- I knew my way out. My ex boss is not someone I trust anymore so I definitely wouldn't trust her husband. My waking dream I'm seeing post it notes with little messages from my boss acknowledging all the ways she had been wrong towards me and a sincere apology and a peace offering and asking me to continue to be a part of her organization. It seemed nice but I have such real life animosity that I shrugged the dream off as a joke. I can always count on these redemptive dreams for people who have wronged me and I usually get a sense of relief from them. This time I didn't. ",,
2789S,"First, I was in a women's prison where the other inmates sodomized me with an apple. Afterward I was upset and tried to use a contraband phone to call someone but when I turned it on, a sound played and the guards heard me. I overheard one guard say ""leave her alone, she's had a rough day."" Next thing I knew, I was driving in a van with a friend. It felt like a flashback in a movie. We drove past a house where the fence was on fire so I called 911 but they didn't believe me. So I went into the station but they didn't believe me because I had a criminal record. When I got angry and yelled at the woman, she became a huge artichoke and started yelling at me then when I saw myself I was an artichoke and she started to try and peel me. I started running away and was being followed by a bunch of little artichokes. I managed to escape but they had completely peeled me. I then was a human again and got back into the van with my friend.  We ended up going into a random house and having very explicit sex and falling asleep there. When we woke up, his girlfriend (also my friend) and another friend were there. The owner of the house started coming downstairs so the first friend convinced him we all came back to his house together. I ran out the room because I had a short time to catch pokemon. I turned into a pokeball and had to charge at pokemon and hit them to catch them but I only had 30 seconds. The last one I had to catch was a bulbasaur that as very scared and I kept apologizing while I caught him. As I changed back into a human I realized the reason all my pokemon were going missing during the day was because I was turning into a pokeball and stealing them at night.",,

27377S,"Fragment:     ""Tu svu sviettam arai.""     Walking across campus, I overhear this strange phrase intoned by the younger of two woman who are discussing the inscriptions on a fragmented cthulhu artifact that they are examining. The artifact is about five inches wide, shaped like a half-sphere with irregular openings at the bottom. The young blonde woman has smaller piece shaped like an obelisk that she fits into one of these openings at an angle.       Earlier dream:   Adam Driver was playing the role of a young man who was disturbingly possessive and clingy of his girlfriend. They have known each other since childhood and were good friends; at adolescence it was natural that they should fall into a relationship. But the girl is feeling smothered by his unwillingness to give her any space. They are still teenagers, and I can't help but feel that the actor is too old for the part, though otherwise well-cast.     The girl was trying to get away from him by riding away invisible on her bicycle. But he follows on his unicycle, using a laser pointer to detect her. Still trying to get away, she sees a door open nearby and steps into a stranger's house, desperately trying to convince the young woman who lives there to give her shelter. The woman is understandably wary, and refuses. ""Then at least call the police!"" pleads the girl. ""You don't ask a black girl to call the police,"" says the woman who lives there (who is black). A roommate of hers, a tough white girl named Minerva, overhears the situation and offers to help the girl out by telling off the guy. At this point I anticipate that the outcome will be violence - I expect that the boy will become enraged and kill Minerva while the girl watches.     Up until now I have only been a disembodied perspective, like a camera, but at this point I intervene. The boy shows up and starts castigating the girl for not meeting him for dinner. He says he's been waiting and waiting; she says she doesn't want to have dinner with him and just wants some space. Before things get violent, I take the boy's hand to soothe and distract him, and we all go out to dinner together. I am holding his hand the whole time, and regard his personality with interest. His insecurity and possessiveness are loathsome to me, but there is something unexpectedly tender and pleasant in the touch of his hand. I wonder if this is not the character I'm sensing but some quality of the actor. The actor usually plays unpleasant individuals, but is likely perfectly nice in RL.

She was surprised I had ever done any serious work. She also ""gifted"" us with a bowling ball sized globe filled with plastic flowers preserved in resin. It was supposed to look like real flowers in a ball of water. I found it odd and nothing I wanted but accepted graciously, but thought it was a regift and knowing I'd only bring it out if they ever visited us.    I've been struggling with what to do about this relationship. It's always been difficult and now it's been months since we've had any contact.

",,
1852S,"Horrible horrible nightmare. I was waiting for my new S.O. (ND). We were on vacation or something. I was staying in a separate apartment. Ran into a girl in my cohort from my PhD program (MS) at some point and she told me I needed a key attached to this leather keychain and pass. I was so tired I could barely keep my eyes open. My dad was screaming at me in his vacation flat in the foyer. I don't remember why and I was scared. I wanted ND to come get me and I think he did at some point. Then I was with my best friend (OD) and he and I were in a room (I think his vacation room? I don't know why everyone I know was on this vacation). and I fell out of a window. I propelled down the side of a building where the other side of the family were staying. It looked sort of like my grandmother's house in Queens. I could see my aunt, mother, grandmother, cousins, and great-grandmother through the windows. I hung onto a white telephone pole cord and swung down apparently without getting hurt. OD was so concerned when I fell out and was running around looking for me. Then when we found each other he had some gorgeous foreign girl with him (I think we were in Germany and she was definitely German). They were being very flirtatious and it bothered me. I was feeling so confused after the fall. He had his arm around me and was helping me back to his place but suddenly he was with this girl too. They didn't seem all that bothered by the fact that I just fell out of a window (probably 3-5 stories up) and was feeling tired and confused. It eventually got to the point where I felt completely left out and not cared about. I got left outside of OD's place and I was starting to feel like I had a concussion. I waited in his building lobby (his building was across from a baseball field. The weather felt like fall) and I think this is when I ran into MS. Other confusing stuff was happening. My head was hurting. People were yelling at me for ruining their vacation. People were threatening to leave the vacation and go home tomorrow if I didn't leave. I agreed that I would just leave tomorrow. Some old guy smugly said that if I were leaving, that he'd stay. I felt so unwanted and alone. I just needed to see OD because I now had to pack everything and I didn't even understand where I was staying. I got to his ""hotel"" room and it was like a fancy, huge dorm room for three people. He had the girl in there and they were under the covers together laughing and giggling and fooling around. I was pleading with him for help and really couldn't be bothered with me. The girl was laughing at me. I just started begging OD to call ND. ND ended up coming to the room and I was so relieved but he didn't care much either. It's like everyone was tired of taking care of me all the time and they were just setting things up together to make it so I wouldn't be their responsibility anymore. I kept getting more confused and hazy and started feeling the side of my head and saying ""it's swelling there are welts I think something is wrong please help"". I tried OD again. No one cared. Finally doctors came into the room and again I was relieved (someone must have called for them) but it was a trap. They put me in a stretcher and were going to intubate me I think? It seemed like I was some kind of experimental patient for COVID-19 human experimentation. ND and OD were in the background talking and laughing about me. They seemed happy to be rid of me. It hurt. The doctors moved in this sort of mass, as if they were one creature, but there were probably 5-7 of them. They had scary blue plastic masks on and were in blue scrubs and splash-back protection gear (the coats- not lab coats- but idk what they are called). They were doing to shove something down my throat, through my tracchia (like a tracheotomy or something?)  and I was screaming trying to back away from them, but I was in a corner on a stretcher. There was nowhere for me to go. I was screaming, ""I don't consent! You need my informed consent! I don't consent to this procedure! Stop!"" They didn't care. This one particular sadistic girl with raven hair and cold eyes was lauging. ND and OD didn't care and I thought the would protect me.¬†They didn't. I was so betrayed and scared everyone was against me. There was nowhere for me to run. The doctors pushed the intubator down into my throat and I told myself ""this can't be real this can't be real. Wake up"". Then, when they pushed it into my throat, the stretcher slid down and back and transformed into an indoor rollercoaster. I was moving slowly backwards in the single cart (it wasn't a train of carts. It was similar to one of those lame haunted house rides at carnivals, but the track was up high close to a warehouse ceiling). Everything was dark and black. I could still hear the raven haired doctor laughing. Her evil smile was burned into my retinas. I just wanted to get out. I knew it had to be a nightmare, but I had no control. I decided to take my seatbelt off and jump down to wake myself up. As soon as I did this, the environment changed again and it was kind of like one of those superman rollercoasters where you are strapped in from above. The cart was upside down and I was suspended almost like a parachuter over at least 3 stories of a drop into a dark black (what looked like) old 1920s theater turned banquet hall. It was devoid of people. I wanted to jump because like I knew it couldn't be real but it felt so fucking real I couldn't let myself fall. I was afraid I might really die. I wondered if I even would want to live if this was my reality. I hung there, suspended and continued contemplating jumping and feeling overwhelmed by how real the experience felt, despite logic telling me it couldn't be real (the environment changing like that, the series of horrible, horrible things that happened- real life just doesn't work that way). But it felt so real. The visual images were so crisp. I could feel a draft of cool air in the warehouse across my face, tickling my forehead as it blew babyhairs across it. I could feel the weight of my body dangling from the foam-plastic straps and the pressure of those straps against my chest and shoulder. It felt so real. I was so upset by this and how confusing it was. I wanted to make myself jump, but I was scared by how real it felt. I didn't want to actually die like that. I think I started screaming. I managed to wake up.¬†I never jumped. I just woke up.",,

I walked out of the building to another one class very similar right down the street.  When I walked in there was a huge snake slithering around on the floor.  It wasn't dangerous and they asked if I wanted to take it down to my class to show the kids.  I picked it up and it was about as big (if not bigger) than me.  I carried it down and put it in my classroom.  The kids were excited and observing it.  Some threw some leaves, rocks and sticks for it to hide under.  After awhile the kids lost interest and I picked up the snake to bring back to the other building classroom.  When I opened their door and put the snake down...a bigger snake came out from the back and started to approach the smaller snake.  I was afraid it would kill it so I brought it back to my building.

I went to put down my things somewhere hurrying in order to sit with my group but when I got back the table was full except for the very end where my group was not.  There was still a glass at the one spot left and no chair but I was told I could get a chair from the table behind where there were plenty. I  moved a chair there and then went to get food and when I returned the once long table was now divided up into 3 or 4 tables and their orientation turned 90 degrees. I was confused.  I awoke.",,
11986S,"I arrived by bike (IRL I don't bike, but two of my friends were telling me about how much they've been biking recently over the weekend) in the rear parking lot of a restaurant. I think there was snow on the ground snow on the ground, because I could see my bike tracks clearly. I decided to use the sole remaining (car) parking spot (not proper bike etiquette, plus, nothing to chain my bike to so it wouldn't get stolen). I walked into the restaurant and it was huge inside with a strong industrial, like a CostCo (I've been seeing news alerts recently for stories about CostCos remaining open despite not great social distancing and personal protective equipment being provided to it's workers). I must have called my food order in ahead (although IRL in MN, you pick up any carry out food orders from outside the restaurant). At first there weren't that many people waiting there, but as the restaurant workers moved us into the larger line area (which looked like a concrete sports or rodeo arena with a wide ovular section for people to walk in with a 3.5-4ft concrete barrier separating it from the center dirt/sand circle in the middle), all of a sudden there was a huge crowd behind me and I was glad to have gotten there early enough to be nearer to the front of the line. Once you made it to the front of the line, you went to the left and sat in the tiered bleachers. As I made it to the front I knew that I'd gotten an earlier email telling me my things were ready for pick up earlier, but I hadn't been able to pick them up until then. As I went to the bleachers, I sat with a guy (who looked like he was out of the Sailor Moon I'd been watching last night). I think in this dream world the norm was that everyone could have two romantic partners, so I was going for his second open spot in his heart.",,
8600S,"I asked someone to pay me back for some clothes they had borrowed, only I think I had the clothes myself. I was in a building with an atrium, like an art gallery, and the woman who owed me money approached me holding a checkbook. She had very long straight brown hair. I hugged her as she began writing out the check. She stopped writing and I realized that she had taken my hug as a signal that I didn't want her to pay me back after all, which I did. We walked outside and she asked someone riding a children's tricycle if they were going uptown, as if they were a taxi she could hop onto. I felt bitter about the clothes but I hadn't paid for them anyway; they had been stolen from Gap. They were plain pedal-pusher pants and some kind of shirt. Then I was in Gap, looking at gingham pants. The XS pants were still too long and I put them back.  Then I was in a drawing class, drawing a self-portrait. The portraits had elements of each of our bodies but the composition was sort of abstract. We were supposed to draw our breasts at the bottom of the page and I kept drawing them way too big or too small.   Then (maybe separate dream?) I was sitting in my office typing an email on my computer. Anna was next to me on her computer, showing something to her RA. I was responding to an email from Emily, who was asking how Marycca (and Emily?) were doing, and asking about everyone on the IT team. Anna and I looked outside. There was a big church in the water surrounded by sailboats. There was a small, old apartment building (like the buildings lining King street in uptown Waterloo) on the edge of the water with the facade missing, so that we could see straight into the apartments. There was a couple on the second floor and the woman was in an old fashioned claw-footed tub, and her partner was sitting beside the tub. I said to Anna, ""I don't think I've realized how nice our view is."" And we said ""there's greenspace... water... lots of sky..."" then the apartment building started tipping sideways and the guy started sliding, but neither of them seemed to notice. We started shouting to let them know. ",,

The scariest part was during the melee a moose killed Snuffleufogus from Sesame Street but then crawled inside his puppet suit to pretend to be him. It was a realistic moose but then he leaned in close to my friends and I and asked if we'd seen Rocky, so I guess he was Bulwinkle?

It was like an IBS situation. We found a museum that was just closing and they let us in and then opened a door to a bathroom that wasn't the normal public restrooms. My friend went in.  He was in there a long time, so I had to leave because the museum was closed. Outside the front door there was a line of people because they had a sleepover at the museum event on. Two ladies stopped me and asked, ""Are you leaving?"" It turned out they wanted to know if there was an opening for their son. I had assumed they were two different mums, not a couple, and I felt guilty that I'd made the assumption. Meanwhile, it was unclear whether they thought I was a student, or a parent. I was neither.   I was urgently trying to text my boyfriend (who worked at the museum, conveniently) to say that my friend was still inside and not to lock up until he left. I was also trying to text my friend to say that I was waiting outside. However, I couldn't type anything, my fingers were too big, or it kept being garbled. I tried voice to text but that didn't work either. The whole time the women were trying to chat with me and I was trying not to be rude by texting at the same time. I saw employees leaving and commenting that someone was in the bathroom probably playing candy crush and they were angry because it delayed them getting off work. I explained to them that my friend had IBS.   This was a super weird dream to me, as usually my stress nightmare would have put me in my friend's position, but instead I was an outside observer, but still stressed!  ",,

In the dream my ex was in a polyamorous relationship with a guy named Tyler who I think was based off this guy who I don't really know - we must have met at some point and now he's my FB friend but I don't remember where I know him from but I see him on my fb feed all the time.  I also see on my fb feed that my ex is in a relationship and has been for about a year, he looks happy and we haven't talked in forever.     My ex and I went back to his apartment and we were passionately making out. He had changed from a rather timid dude when I knew him to this pretty aggressive confident guy which I found super hot. he had tattoos all over his body which I complimented, but upon closer inspection they were actually temporary tattoos. He told me that he got caught with them in a video that conservative twitter got ahold of and heavily criticized him for. He showed me the video, it was of a couple young people playing in the water near a beach (lakeside, not ocean). He appeared in the video for all of 1 second, and I could barely tell it was him and that he had tattoos in it. I said as much, so he rewinded to a still frame where he was visible. he pointed out that he was shirtless, with tattoos, and some visible small breasts. He said that was shat the conservatives were taking offense to - the fact that he was a trans man but still had his tits and was going around shirtless. But even though that was their real complaint, they were using the tattoos as like a dogwhistle? We went back to making out.  He pulled out a rope and started tying me up which I found incredibly hot except that he didn't use a single column tie around my wrist, he used a slipknot which self tightens and is not a good knot for shibari. He started threatening me with punishment if i didn't follow the rules, which i also found super hot, but i kept breaking the rules on purpose to get more slaps in the face. But after I kept repeatedly breaking the rules, he broke character and asked if I was comfortable. I was really bummed that he didn't understand that I was being bratty on purpose. I tried to explain that to him but couldn't really find any words to explain it, I just like kind of mumbled and he didn't understand. he untied me and went into the bathroom while i collected my thoughts. When he came out, I was able to explain what I meant to him ""I was being bratty on purpose, I actually quite liked that whole scene."" But he was dressed in full formal attire and said that he had to go. I was really disappointed that I wasn't able to explain myself in time and we didn't actually get a chance to have sex. I asked how long he had till he had to go and he said ""umm pretty much right now."" I had my stuff scattered all over the apartment and I thought it would take me ages to get everything together to the point where I could leave, so I asked him if I could have a spare key so that I could lock myself out after I left. He said no, and looked really uncomfortable, suggested I could just leave the door unlocked because he's in an apartment building and the building door locks. However, during that statement I actually managed to collect all of my stuff, and I was ready to go.     I then asked the next time we could do this again and he said something like ""wouldn't you feel guilty with your boyfriend and stuff?"" and I said something like ""NO, I want to continue this and he will NEVER EVER KNOW"" but as I said it, I felt an extreme amount of guilt. He explained his schedule to me and the next time that he would be available, but I was really distracted thinking about what my boyfriend would think if he ever knew. I kind of wanted to tell my ex that my boyfriend wouldn't mind if I cheated on a girl, but I knew that would really really offend my ex since he's not a girl, he's actually a man. I was disappointed in myself because I thought I had gotten over the notion that vagina = girl. I also started thinking not just about my own guilt, but also how angry my boyfriend would be at me. I really didn't want him to be that angry at me. At this point it occurred to me that I would not be able to keep this a secret forever. My BF would eventually find out, so the the gears started turning around how I could lessen the blow as much as possible. ",,

The first dream involved me working at Home Depot with a manager at an old retail job I worked at, which I hated and didn't seem to make that much money from so it was a wash. Anyway, I think I quit that job at Home Depot in my dream. The next dream I was in some weird house in the winter - maybe I saw flashlights in the distance? The third dream was me, sick at some party, and I saw people I knew like one of my grandfathers, and a whole host of other people, random and non-random looking, and I felt sick in the dream (I have a cold now), and I may have coughed or sneezed in the air and I freaked out because I thought it was COVID. The fourth dream was my dad driving me around ""my high school"" but it wasn't my high school - the campus looked different. For example, the football field was in the center of campus instead of the edge of campus like my high school, and it was surrounded by tall, dark, brick-like structures that made the field look ominous. Also, I went into a hockey rink (I used to play hockey) and these high-school aged-guys were doing various things: some were just off the ice and had some equipment on but were fooling around and causing trouble, and some guys working concession stands were fooling around too. It was a silly atmosphere and I didn't love being there.",,

So I regularly snuck into Canada (it's so close) by boat to purchase ethrane for US$1,303 each canister.  I'd place it on a credit card, then sell it before the bill was due.  If only I was this industrious IRL, haha.  Well, the hospitals were leery of accepting a pirated product; so I approached plastic surgery clinics.  They'd transformed into single-patient treatment clinics for the ultra-rich folks.  They gladly would pay for the ethrane and sold ""care packages"" to their clients for extremely high rates.  Unfortunately, in the moment of my dream, my ethrane purchase ended up on a friend's credit card, which meant I must immediately pay her for the mistake.  I had less control of the billing dates.  It was frightening, so I awakened.  Later, I dreamed I was experimenting with rodent deterrents.  For some reason, sugar + baking soda was most effective.  I started selling it to people to make money.",,

I brought it up to him, and then realized that it wasn't a one-time thing from years ago but rather an ongoing attempt to get her attention. I got angry, and left him. The rest of that dream was me thinking about how upset I was and trying to figure out where I was going to live.  Next dream was one in which I went to Costco wearing a mask. I was accosted (HA! ACCOSTed at the COSTCO!) by one of those groups that believe masks are ineffective and we should not be wearing them. Some guy ripped my mask off and coughed on me. ",,

We took his keys and drove off in his police car. We responded to a call posing as officers. Needed a place to hide. But then my family showed up who definitely knew we weren't officers.

The crackers were also really fancy, but they were for feeding birds, so we had to pretend we were feeding birds, while eating half of it ourselves.  Part 2: I arrived late to some sort of lecture theatre and they were preparing to do some sort of broadcast. I remember them binding all the electrical cables to the AV equipment with some hand-cranked tool/machine I hadn't seen before.  I needed to get another staff member's attention because my laptop had an error message on it. We went to his office where there were lots of different stools to sit on. I couldn't work out where to sit, because each stool seemed too high or too low. The IT guy (for want of a better description) sat down but then I noticed that his legs were in a giant cobweb that had formed between the stools, suggesting that no one had sat there for a long time.

I had purchased a bag of stuffed animals as a gift and I showed them to some friend. I was not interested in eating so I walked around carefully avoiding the kids playing to a mens bathroom with strange customs. No bowls you sat on wood rail ang they came around and mopped.

Then somehow I was back at my parents' house in Tennessee and I was there with my kids. I wanted to show my kids the sunrise, but when we went outside the house and sun position had shifted hours and 45 degrees so the sun was rising from the south.  It was very disconcerting.",,

I stared in shock at the group of people gathered in my home and then in shock stared at the white horse struggling in the churning waters and I started crying saying ""He's just a poor horse! We have to save him!"" Somehow the dream switched and I was outside struggling against the pouring rain and deeping waters hanging on to a rope I'd tied around a telephone pole and with a lasso in my hand was forcing my way out to this white horse. The horse sensed I was trying to help it so it turned towards me and tried to come my way, as I neared it I saw its Red eyes glowing and like a knowing stare emitting from him. I screamed as the horse charged me and someone grabbed the rope and yanked me back forcibly away from the horses hoofs. I remember being in shock that I had come face to face with Death.

I was inside of a school bus with other students even though it was night time. These spheres appeared in various places-the sky, just outside the window, right inside the bus-and exploded with a fiery wave like the sun's corona. I strangely recall understanding these floating, zigzagging spheres as 5G drones, some sort of new technological invention where internet signals were provided through these meteoritic balls. Each time they zipped nearby, I felt struck by anxiety and fear. When they exploded, I could feel the heat radiating from the combustion, like standing too close to an open flame. In the dream I looked at my phone and saw the internet bars go from 1 to 5, indicating a very powerful wifi signal. Overall, the dream was pretty chaotic and I struggled to grasp the tangibility of the detached setting in its open-skied, nightly existence.  ",,

A woman took me upstairs to show me the apartments which were more like townhomes. The small one was $50,000 and the large one was $110,000. Both of them had a very narrow hallway to enter and the walls were painted orange and green in Keith Harring type imagery. The bigger, more expensive one had windows and two lofts, but the smaller one had a tiny kitchen. I didn't like it but was loathe to spend $110,000 on an apartment instead of a house.",,

She asked if I'd at least call police and again I said No, I wasn't bothering police with a rat loose. She started sobbing harder and so I handed her my cell and said you call them, I'm not. She dialed and put it on speaker phone, a police recording came on saying that they were busy with a mass shooting across town and everyone should avoid the area. She hung up and I took my phone from her. My dream then switched. I was in my vehicle stuck in traffic, bumper to bumper. When I saw a school bus coming the wrong way on the side of the lane at a high rate of speed, with another school bus on its heels.  Suddenly a semi blaring its horn appears in the same road side lane barreling towards the buses. I scream and jump out of my car on the passenger side and run towards the woods at the other side of our highway.  I hear enormous screeching of metal, tires, horns and I drop down and stick my fingers in my ears to block out the horrific crash of buses and semi. When the noise settles some, I rise up and look and can't believe my eyes.  One bus is totally smashed, almost flat, the other bus has front and side of driver smashed. The semi is almost unharmed except for some front grill damage. I stand there in shock. Hearing people screaming for help. Some of the cars, mine included were nothing but flat metal, smashed completely flat. People were trying to help those trapped, and I was afraid of the bus exploding because it had started to catch fire. I screamed for them to get away, the bus was going to explode.

Around 6pm I took a nap, but when I woke up, and went into the kitchen, I saw wet footprints on the floor (they only led into the apartment, not out too, yet I didn't realize the significance that that meant the person was still there while I was sleeping), and I looked up to notice that there was a new, narrow door in the wall that hasn't been there before, and the door couldn't lock from the inside, only the outside, with a latch (not a key-based lock). It crossed my mind that it was strange that I didn't hear the construction noises of a wall being cut open and a door installed while I slept, but I explained it as being further evidence of me being a deep sleeper (which I am IRL). I don't recall calling anyone for help, but a guy who looked like a younger version of the property manager of the building where I lived 3 years ago (Darren) was suddenly there with a young woman who I think was a detective, but looked like a friend of a friend of mine, Angelina. She looked around the apartment (though this whole time the lighting remained low and golden, like from the microwave light only, it didn't feel strange that neither I nor the others turned on more lights; maybe it was the cinematic quality of wet footprints in low lighting ?) and didn't find anything. She was clearly busy, and had come in to look around in an unofficial capacity as a favor to the property manager (for some reason I just have called not-Darren vs. 911? I was chatting with friends about what it would look like if we moved into a police-free state last night before bed), even after not-Darren left. That said, she went over to a desk in the middle of the living room (which I don't have IRL) and she was making notes in the light of a small lamp on that table. She seemed to be getting ready to go, and said that she assumed I was part of the building's improv theatre group (while doesn't exist IRL, though I did theatre in middle and high school - the implication was that she was part of it and would see me there), but when I answered that I wasn't, not-Angelina paused and decided to stay with me for a bit.  The scene changed, I was at someone's house, and was looking through the cupboards like I was trying to figure out if the bakeware would tell me if it was my house; it did, and it want my house. There was someone else there, though I don't think it was not-Angelina. I looked through the glass doors to the deck and saw the grill was on fire, with high flames. Two neighborhood men rushed over and started fighting the flames before I could get there, but when we opened the grill (the flames went out by the time I reached the grill), the salmon fillets inside were untouched by flames and we're actually undercooked, almost slightly smoked on the bottom layer?",,

There was a cleaning/ delivery crew employed by my apartment complex. They were responsible for cleaning hallways/grounds and delivering things that we ordered online. I was in the hallway sorting some stuff and one of the cleaning crew was pushing her cart and I let her by. She peeked into my apartment and said ""did you just move in?"" Um.. no? I've lived here 3 years? But I didn't recognize her either so I thought it was ok.. she then started crying and saying she was so scared of getting this virus and she'd been promised a raise twice already and never got it. Then one of her coworkers came and delivered a ""package"" for me. It was a whole cart. And only 2 boxes were what I ordered. The rest were like bags and files that belonged to someone else. The person that delivered my cart started to console the crying woman and I took the cart into my apartment, but left the door open. (Leaving my door open in this dream really bothers me. I would never leave my door open and I had a neighbor that did this and it made me SO uncomfortable) While I'm going through the stuff on this cart, I find a bunch of stuff belonging to Valerie. Valerie used to be my old property manager but she quit a year or so ago. There was mail, opened and unopened with her name and a bank bag. The bank bag was apparently used by the delivery crew to keep track of when they delivered to the certain person's bank bag and there was a bunch of cash stuffed in between papers. Randomly thr oi without the bag. $10 here, flip though papers and see $20, a small wad, keep flipping.. see more papers then more cash. I saw this and thought.. is Valerie living here? She quit her job and is just a tenant? And why is there so much cash in here!? I kept looking though the cart and saw a bank bag that was mine. I rarely had any deliveries, but this bag still had a bunch of papers and cash in it. I thought this was so weird.. but I guess I just couldn't or didn't want to read the papers. I just knew they were some kind of internal receipts for the delivery people. As I'm trying to figure out why there was so much cash and realizing that maybe the delivery person didn't mean to give me this whole cart.. Valerie and my friend that lives in a different town 2 hours away show up in my livingroom. They say the place is looking good. They give me advice on where to move things and then Valerie asks where my dog is. I said he's asleep on my bed. I can't believe that he hasn't come out yet! And then she goes over to the bedroom and tries to pet him over the knee wall and he lunges at her. He's naroing and growling and I'm trying to get him to calm down. But she's not intimidated, she keeps trying to pet him! I was like.. please stop?! What if he bites you? Leave him alone! And then I woke up.",,

He locked one of my sisters up in the basement and threatened my other younger sister and me that he was going to kill her if we told anything to the police. I believed he was going to kill her anyway, so one day I secretly sneaked out of the house (nobody knew, at least not my dad because he was busy keeping my sister in the basement). I ran quite far away from our apartment and made a call to the police. They came into hour apartment and started questioning my dad before they took him to the police station. We were relieved because we knew that he was going to jail for what he'd done. There also was this incident (can't recall when in the dream timeline) where I noticed that my dad were going to inject my mother and two younger sisters with insulin. In real life, I saw this on a TV series (Deadwater Fell), in where the main suspect, also a dad of two girls, injected both them and the mother with insulin so that they died, before he set their house on fire.

13922S,"I found myself in a place that felt familiar, even deeply significant, in a way that I could not place. A rural road ended in a turnaround, a loop of gravel. The grass in the loop and next to the road was brown and withered. The light was even and grey, the timeless twilight of dream.     I was standing on the gravel loop, alone, on foot. It was on an elevated embankment that pitched steeply down to open fields on either side. The far end might have been a line of trees. The field on the right consisted of neatly trimmed grass interspersed with earthen plots, widely spaced, each containing a small white tube poking out of the ground. I thought it might be the arrangement for an incipient orchard. In the distance, adjacent to the long straight line of the road, was a large rectangular house. It was painted a dark color, but the windows were also dark, as though it were unoccupied or all the inhabitants were asleep.     On the opposite side was a field of similar dimensions, but no house. This field was fallow and untended, fully of scraggly grass and tall weeds. In the distance, in about the same position that the house occupied across the road, was an orchard of mature trees.     I did not know why the place felt significant, but I wanted to record my observations in my dream journal. I pick up my journal but all the pages are full, and I cannot find a blank one. Impatient to write before my perceptions fade, I pick up a pen and start writing on the back of my hand. I worry that the letters will be illegible, so I look around for my journal. The other one was full, so it can't have been my current one. I find a second volume, and this one does have blank pages. But now I'm having trouble with the pens! I finally find one that works and start writing. Only I'm worried... I know that anything I write in this book is unlikely to persist after waking. But the writing on my hand, that will last, right? Because I bring that with me into the waking world?  [Dream logic.]   ",,

(This prompted me to ask him to remove it, since our mutual friends may assume it's I or associate me with this photo & he is using my face as his own.  I should be able to have some jurisdiction over my likeness; yet Facebook says, ""No,"" and it remains his picture.)    I am with other people, so I remain civil, not mentioning this issue.  I quietly refuse to eat or drink anything he serves me, and I socialize with my friends at a round, glass-topped wrought-iron cafe table.    A friend from high school is there with me.  IRL, she inherited the Los Angeles Times and went to Wimbledon...qualifying to play in the tournament.  She had photos of herself rowing crew.  I had no idea she rowed and I wanted to join her group.  I noticed another girl with whom I'd rowed in the past was there, but she ignored me and I could not understand her reason.  (I think all this part of the dream stems from two separate offers to join them last minute last night, but I had to decline for a valid reason.  Then they evaporated after I told them I was not available.  Today my phone is filled with text apologies, so all is well.)  Soon these friends disappeared and I was left with the bill.  Usually, I am the wealthiest person in the group; so Marianne's presence failed to make me realize she should have paid her share. (Not that I pay for everyone IRL at all, but I always am aware of this discrepancy and its ramifications.)  The older couple who owns the shop started to chitchat with me as I looked at tchotchkes, when a very drugged college girl entered.  They enlisted me to take her back to her dorm.  I had no idea where she lived, and she could not utter it; so we ended up at my apartment and deduced things from there.  Eventually, she was settled and I had to return the black SUV the cafe owners let me borrow for the mission.  I recall thinking how kind it was for complete strangers to entrust me with their car.  The woman owner and I decided to get something to eat; but now it was dark and I was driving and I could not for the life of me find the headlights.  Finally, we stopped along the side of the road to locate them above the visor and then I awakened.",,
15218L,"I found myself in Reykjavik with a male traveling friend Bradford from decades ago.  It was night the whole time we were there.  He had surprised me with this trip and I kept wondering how many days we were staying.  He never would answer that question when I asked.    At one point, we were doing our own thing and I ended up a little outside the main area of the city at a dance studio.  At that moment a very famous black male dancer was about to perform and I was backstage with the group, observing.  I did not recognize the name of his dance company, but he was from New York.  He was dancing with a heavyset yet very adept nude female in a very dramatic and syncopated fashion.  It was mesmerizing.    Backstage, I had put down my cell phone on a small Louis IV glossy wooden table stand with an overflowing plant taking up much of the space.  It looked like a Kindle, all wrapped in that fake leather binder, but with some heavy plastic off-white rounded retro-modern ""box"" under it, attached with a USB cord.    When it came time to leave, I picked it up and proceeded outside.  A double-decker silver bus with no roof was backing into a stall just past the door to the building.  Of all things, there was Bradford in the last seat.  I gingerly was able to step straight into the back of the bus and I expressed my surprise it was so easy to find him.    The bus took us into town and folks were talking about a surprise concert--I'm looking out the window as I type and I can see the first chipmunk of this year.  So beautiful!--that I wanted to attend.  Bradford is not enamored by music or anything not practical.  I tried to convince him it was possible & desirable, but did not know when we were leaving Iceland.  I tell him about the Sigur Ros performance I attended years ago in a Reykjavik high school gym; but he didn't know that band.  Then I told him of the GusGus event, where we all were smashed together, dancing in unison, tall girls' breasts gyrating into our backs; but, again, no reception. There was no convincing Bradford live music was worthwhile.    Suddenly we are ice skating indoors and he pulls out a bright yellow condom.  He said, ""I never know when I will need it, but I don't want to miss an opportunity.""  For a moment, I realize how long it has been since I've experienced anything sexual with another human, and I momentarily consider Bradford.  Then I realize it would change the travel dynamic.    After a few hours, I find my phone and realize this off-white attachment is not mine.  It's called a ""Just Jared"" (which I thought I never had heard of until I looked that guy up a few minutes ago) and Apple had considered it its first ""smart"" electronic machine.  I somehow knew it was worth US$500,000 and we spent the rest of the dream trying to find the owner.  I could not leave Reykjavik with it in my possession; but I did not feel ethical handing it to some stranger to not steal.  For some reason, the police were not an option.  I needed to find the actual owner to return it to him or her.    That's all I can recall.",,

The inside of the house was not very nice, and most of the bedrooms didn't even have four walls, they were just blocked off on two sides by furniture. The kitchen was also very small and the layout was weird. I was extremely mad he bought a new house for us without discussing it with me.

It was a 2 way avenue, 2 lanes each way, with a separation in the middle. The separation was a bunch of rock and trees. As we were late, Gabi suggested us to cross in the middle, not where pedestrians should cross. I followed. We were in the middle of the 2 ways, climbing up the rocks and trees, able to see the other side of the road. She jumps into the street and starts calling me. I am afraid of jumping the other way, so she stays in the middle of the cars calling me. I see trucks and cars coming high speed.

One dream was a conversation between me and a child I delivered in 2014. He was asking me if I'd be his mother's midwife for the third child on its way. I explained to the child that I wouldn't be because his mother would have to want that and so far she hadn't asked me. He was surprised because he said I had been a good midwife for him when he was born. I told him I will always be his midwife. He seemed happy with that.    Another dream I'm staying in an apartment building temporarily until I figure out what I'm doing with my life- and yet I was invited by my old job to do a presentation on Covid-19 and it's effects on breastfeeding- in Spanish. I don't know how or why I agreed and I was struggling to find the right outfit in this temporary crash pad. I eventually show up and do the presentation and people were happy, have lots of questions, and I stay awhile and chat. The crowd loved me. And I act pretty stuck up on my way out in order to show spite to my Old job. Very weird.     The next part of the dream i go to a local diner (in Spain) to celebrate and eat a meal. For some reason I get up from my table and go and eat from someone else's plate. I grab the hamburger and chomp down on it and go to town. The lady returns to her seat and is horrified that I'm eating her food, and I just keep eating it without regard for her response. She's hollering and demanding I be stopped and all the employees tell her to relax and they'll make her a fresh plate and not charge her. She refuses the offer and is demanding that I stop eating the food, she's yelling at me to stop and spit it out and not to swallow her food. I just keep eating because I'm feeling a hunger I hadn't felt before and I could only keep eating. I take her plate and go back to my seat and I continue to eat and I'm shocked I'm just eating someone else's food and getting away with it. ",,

This occurred as someone ""really didn't want her to come back; which sparked something¬†to happen"" although it was unclear who had it in for the main character. The character's memory was very fuzzy; and she needed access to some items that exited the book with her; including measuring utensils (e.g. Tsp/Tbsp dry measure spoons) books and bracelets.

As I got out of my car someone from work appeared and we started walking though I wasn't sure where we were going. Then we were with many people heading down these industrial type stairways. We climbed over a divider to our left and we're going down a narrower staircase. The stairs seemed to be taking us to the ocean, but my town is not near the coast. The staircase we were going down was closing off. The person from work and another person went over the fence which was low at this point and dropped down to the ground which was 6 or 8 feet down and grassy.

Other things were going on and at one point someone asked me to come up with a playlist for a party she was planning, and she took out some weird type of cd player/stereo system and I asked is that mine? And she said no, it's...someone's, I forget. I remember hoping the party wasn't within the next couple of days because I'm really busy.

It was night, but not fully dark despite the lack of civilisation near us. I think we had a prairie type buggy. We stopped at a ramshackle house and constructed some fences around it and a new door from old lumber scraps, but some intruder kept breaking things. We finally decided to ambush the intruder by crouching behind the fence. We heard movement and rolled her up in pieces of scrap wood, then bent the wrapped up person's knees sideways so her legs would break. There were awful creaking noises but no indication that the person felt the pain. We took away the scrap wood and saw a grinning skeleton with a thin coating of decayed flesh, clearly long dead. Then I woke up. Very creepy dream.",,

At one point we spotted a father and son in one of the areas we were in. They saw us and started to approach us.  We were going down hill most of the way.  We saw the people and moved quickly to avoid.  We jumped down from the roof of a building and one of the people I was with hurt herself.

We were walking along and even though he was a baby he knew the word and melody of a whole song that we were singing.  I was kissing him and so proud of him.

At one point I feel a thickness block my nostril and so I grab a q-tip and insert it in my nostril to see what's blocking it. I gasped in shock as this HUGE clot of sinus mucus, dark green, thick and gross starts to come out. The more I pull on it with the qtip the more it keeps coming until suddenly it plops out with an audible gush and falls into the toilet. It's about the size of a man's fist and full of gross old scabs and tons of infection. I grab a kleenex to wipe my nose and in seconds the kleenex is soaked because my nostril is still draining and seeping green infection.  It drains about 5 minutes before it finally stops. I raise up realizing I can actually breath better now and in amazement stare at the huge clot in the toilet. Suddenly someone knocks on the bathroom door and startles me.

I was working in the resource room at school and my son came in.  I think he was only supposed to stay for a half hour but I was so happy he was there that he stayed the rest of the afternoon with me.  I walked him back to his class before dismissal.  The Special Ed. teacher and principal at our school handed me a folder of work to use for an old student that I was 1:1 with for 3 years.  She was difficult to work with and her behavior was very challenging.  One of the reasons that I took a different position at school.  Anyway, I was contemplating how I was going to work with her and keep her motivated.  Then the dream morphed into my oldest son.  He was a young teenager (he's 29 now).  He was in school also.  As we were leaving school we had to go through a rustic turn stile (sp?).  As we were weaving through I looked to my right and in the opening of the wall were weasels or some kind of rodents.  They were moving about in the wall and it was repulsive and scary.  Then we exited safely but some got down near my feet.  In another dream three of us were outside moving a big heavy something and my brother stepped in to help.  Right behind him was a big snake.  I alerted him and he held on to what we were moving but tried to kick out to scare the snake away.  It kept moving back toward him.  Finally he reached down and tried to feed a smaller snake to the big snake.  In another dream my oldest son and I went into an apartment of some guys he knew.  It was off an alley in the city and we had to climb a rickety metal stairwell that was half on.  When we got to the second floor we climbed in.  We were there for a short time and then my son realized he had to be somewhere so we left.  Then I was drinking in the city and there was a young man in a car driving sporadically.  I talked to him from the window and he had fallen asleep.  I asked him if he was ok and he said yes but he was really tired.  I told him to roll down the windows and turn the music up loud to wake himself up.  His car kept rolling down and bumping off buildings into traffic.",,

But there was much confusion about who could take my payment and when and how, and in the meantime, people kept getting closer to me, much closer than I wanted them to be. Some of them wanted to hang out and play cards within my personal space radius. Another was surreptitiously sidling up and poking me for fun because he could tell I hated it. My low-risk interaction was turning into a high-risk interaction, but I didn't feel I could leave without paying because I'd been handling that cookie, which was starting to look shopworn. Eventually I melted down and started yelling about how I was going to have to spend two weeks wondering if buying a goddamn cookie was going to kill me because SOME PEOPLE couldn't establish appropriate precautions and behave reasonably in dangerous times.

I lived in a HUGE complex of odd steel and glass connected by a web of ramps, ladders, exposed girders, open stairs, catwalks, narrow trestle bridges to platforms that were all non-liner, a free form web, quite tricky to navigate, most of the living quarters were at what would be 20-50 feet in height above the ground going on for city blocks at a stretch. The only imagery that I can convey would be that of an interconnected metal forest of treehouses.     Everyone in the complex had their own or shared detached steel ladders to the surface as secondary/emergency egress (detached for defense) from their living quarters but when the storm came those ladders would fall, be blown away and would create more damage as they were being blown about.     Since I seemed to be the only one aware of the impending storm I started running through the complex to warn the residents to bring their ladders indoors and to prepare to evacuate  because without their ladders they might be trapped high in the tangle of damaged metal. I knew there would be a terrible toll on the community.     I only got through a part of the complex before the storm hit buckling metal and partially blocking my route/s home. As I raced homeward already winded from running and climbing through the maze to warn people I despaired of making it home in time as the community was collapsing around me.

A lot of chasing and hand to hand combat. We went all over the house trying to corner each other and throwing punches when we could. I pushed him down the stairs and saw blood coming out of his head. So, I figured I had killed him. There were other people in the house, so I ran outside and went to take his bicycle he rode there. Turns out that he brought some girl with him that was yelling at me that she needed that bike, it was his and she needed to use it. So I fought this girl too, then rode off to the woods. I was hiding in the woods, thinking about what I was going to do, then I was back in the house. He wasn't dead, just bleeding and we were chasing each other around the house again.

My husband came into the bedroom to bring what I assumed would be coffee, but he brought my old voice teacher with him, a woman I have an awkward relationship with.

She said she was freaking out, I thought she meant about sharing the drink, but then she said it was about medicine. She thought she had to shove it all the way up her nose. I told her that the medicine she had was just a pill (she held up what looked like a Zyrtec pill bottle). Around us people were being handed envelopes revealing the results of corona virus tests. I saw the disappointment as people opened the envelope and found out they were positive. We said we had to wait for the cloud symbols in the air before we could go get tested.

I watched the video and I had not focused on any particular person, but I was highly aware of all the security men in black outfits.

Fair warning the contents of the dreams are pretty disturbing, however it's not uncommon for me to have dreams like this since the outbreak started.    1. I was in a parking garage at work. For some reason it was crowded, and a lot of people were trying to leave. I am with coworkers packing my car to leave. I see two parents with two young children - the mom is holding a toddler and walking next two a ~6 year old. For some reason, the dad is looking to pick up a delivery order. The mom is going on and on about ""where's your brother? Have you seen your brother?"" A car pulls up, the dad reaches in the window and picks up the food, he than says ""ok we can go now, lets go find (whatever  the missing kids name was"". Just as he says this, the crowd dissepates a little, and I see what is a blue baby blanket with an infant wrapped up in it. The baby's skull was completely crushed. It was incredibly graphic. My coworkers immediately start vomitting. The parents are catatonic. I run for help. I get to the security office and am screaming for help, but no one is doing anything. I leave, and return to my car. Everyone is gone, including the kid. The blanket was still there.    That dream woke me up. I finally fell back to sleep, and:    2. I work on a neuro unit that has a lot of confused people. They sometimes get delirious/violent. I have also worked in Emergency Medicine which has a high degree of workplace violence. In my dream, I'm having a discussion with my boss. All of a sudden I hear ""HIT THE PANIC BUTTON AND RUN"" (the panic button is a button on my unit that sends all available security officers to your unit and signifies serious emergency). I see a man round the corner with a twisted look on his face. He's carrying a machete. There are mutiple people I work with in a crowd attempting to restrain him. He says ""You won't stab me because I'll get you first"". I bolt. But I can't run away fast enough. My boss is running too - in front of me - but is moving too slow. I finally break away but wind up in a bathroom with no lock. At this point I become conscious that I am having a dream but cannot move or wake myself up. I finally open my eyes after what felt like a few seconds but can't move. I'm able to move again after a few more.     COVID dreams are nuts.",,

Rebecca was asking my opinion about something that seemed trivial. Later, the new hires and I were walking through the hallways of the building for lunch. Most of the new hires couldn't afford to buy lunch in the building but they said I could. I guessed that my salary must be higher than theirs. I was walking with a tall youngish guy and as we walked along a path outside I saw a bloodied dog head on the ground and recognized it as Sam's, another new hire. I was horrified but didn't say anything because I didn't want to upset my friend. We got back to the part of the building where we were working and he got upset and stepped out onto a balcony and I went out to comfort him. We found Sam and told him we had something bad to tell him. Sam collapsed and fell off the balcony and hit something on the way down and there was blood. I told him what happened to his dog, although I said I'm not totally sure that it is your dog, but it did look like your dog and I want to prepare you for that possibility. I felt I was very good at comforting people and being in crisis mode.     Maybe another dream: I was in a car with Steve and he was describing our first kiss in detail.

I check my brothers chip and no response. I Start to  scream and plead for his life. I scream I love you Michael! And I hear ""you"" come from the chip. A sign of life! My brothers alive.

There were lots of rooms and people were moving in and out of them. A midwife colleague of mine reached out and asked me to hurry and come help her, a woman was giving birth on a counter in the far end of the room. She was giving birth to a very premature stillbirth, perhaps a 6 month old fetus. There was no equipment so I ran to get gloves at least. By the time I returned to the birth, it was all cleaned up and the woman who gave birth was dressed and ready to leave. She looked relieved and unbothered that she had lost a child. She had a dumb bell in her hand and it looked like she was in workout clothes and about to go on a run. I said to her how much is that weight and she said 5 lbs. I told her she had just experienced something very intense that requires lots of rest in order to heal from it. She replied she's fine and she's not going to lift more than 5 lbs and she's going for a run. I explained she needs to observe her bleeding and go to the hospital if she fills a pad in an under an hour. She smiled and said sure thanks. I replied okay take care. I turned to my colleague and she thanked me for saying all that because however she had tried to talk to her, the woman was not receptive, and I was able to get through to her even in just the tiniest way so she could be healthy after this birth. After this part of the dream I notice my throat hurts and my neck is swollen. I go to a mirror and open my mouth and can see I have HUGE tonsils stones. I try to get them out, but I'm sneaking around to do it because there's so many people around. I could get one out, and another would come through again. They just kept coming. I finally figured out how to take them out without anyone noticing and had handfuls that i was wrapping in paper napkins. Eventually I go to the restroom and go in the mirror again and reach for the stone and as soon as I touch it it burst into a liquid that filled my mouth and I spit it out. I felt grossed out. In the dream I wondered if I was very sick with something I've never had before. I wondered if I had a type of cancer. ",,

I can be outside dumping the garbage, arrive through my door and my phone is busily calling Jose from the table where I left it.  It happens nearly daily and would be okay if Jose wasn't a person to see everything as ""a sign"" we need to be closer.  At first I thought I was wrong, that Jose was calling me and telling me I was calling him; but he has let me listen to the voicemails my phone leaves of me going about my day in the background.      Problem is Jose is like a house painter, ever the born-again Christian living in a fantasy world, never engaging in reality, never listening.  In fact, when another neighbor exploded at me for no discernible reason, Jose reacted by saying, ""Well, I'm happy everything is alright now,"" just to quell his anxiety at this confrontation.  I had to turn my attention to Jose to say, ""No, it obviously is not alright,"" hoping he could defend me from this aggressive man.  He didn't.  He just became silent.  Therefore, I relegated Jose to passerby status for me, yet my phone desires to keep him tethered, haha.      So my dream involved Jose accompanying me to different tasks; since, in real life, he desperately wishes to ride in my red car on a nice day with the top down.  I could not escape him and his future plans for us he kept espousing!  That's all I remember.",,

It was the desert with tall mountains.  I could not get myself ready/presentable to see them.  Each time I tried, I would become involved in whatever transpired in that house.

We were on the train and when in Stockholm, I remember taking her to a public restroom to wash our hands. I also needed to go to the bathroom, but she didn't want to come with me and as I tried to convince her (I wouldn't leave a 5-year old alone in the center of Stockholm even for a few min while I'm in the bathroom), some other people passed us and they did not consider social distancing. One older man who seemed talkative and was probably originally from a foreign country was smiling and talking to my daughter and patted her on her head and back, and touched her face. I tried to tell him to keep distance because of corona and my daughter was coughing. I was worried about that we would get infected.

When my fingertips were being cut off I had the sense that this was a horror movie; and that I had previously read the synopsis and that this part would be over soon. So I closed my eyes like I do in really scary parts of movies to get through it. We bested him by burning him in hot cooking oil; his arms and face were burned off. When we got out we were reacused by a group of people, but they shot the other man who had been with us in the head because he only had 1 arm. They did this saying he would be a burden even though he had military training and had been really helpful this far.

All I remember is that I was thinking about how long it has been since the pandemic has started in my country (in the dream I specifically remembered it had started in march 18th last year, but in real life I don't remember the exact day at all, just that it was by mid/late March), and the fact that it's been more than a year but the situation is still terrible where I live made me feel a very extreme sensation of dread and desperation in the dream (much more intense than what I feel or have felt in real life in regards to the pandemic).",,

I walked into the pizza place, but realized that it wasn't the same store I had ordered from (but same chain). I asked the young person working there if I could have just a slice, because I had left my slice from the same restaurant in my box. Oh sure, she said, I'll give you the employee slice. They're really good. She meant they had individual slices for employees to eat. I waited for my slice to be heated. They were calling out orders. I wondered what mine would be called. Then they gave me my pizza in a brown paper tray.    I was eating alone in a Chinese restaurant. I was sitting in a square booth in the middle of the empty restaurant. Then I was with two people, one of whom was a trans lady. We made out. Later I was at a small gathering, a high school reunion. I think it was at Stephanie's house. I ran into the living room and jumped on Stephanie. Keira and Abby were there and I wanted to say hi but first Stephanie and I were cuddled together on the couch. When I jumped on her we were wearing pajamas but now we were wearing fancy dresses. We talked about the two strangers and I told her I had made out with one of them.¬†    I was in a small room with three exercise machines. The person at the end was attractive. We were wearing similar outfits. Camo and plaid. My friend was in the middle between us.¬†    I was on my way somewhere and ran into Timo. He was conducting job interviews. He asked me if I was coming. I must have had one scheduled. No, I said, I can't today. I had plans to see Daniel, who I only see every ten years and wouldn't miss it. I asked Timo if I could interview tomorrow. He said no, only tonight. I said sorry but I can't. We were standing in front of an open door to a room where a men's choir was about to rehearse. A cute blond man in the front with shoulder-length blond hair tied back smiled at me. I was embarrassed at first and looked away but then smiled back at him. He kept smiling at me. Later, I couldn't get in touch with Dan. There was something wrong with my phone display. Then it was 8:30 pm, past the time we had planned to meet. I was tired. I was also supposed to hang out with Eddie. I had double-booked myself. I texted Eddie, probably to cancel. I got a text from Victoria (Dan's partner) saying I should come watch the monkeys. Nicky and Anna were playing music, jazz I think, and there were baby monkeys dancing. One monkey was bigger than the rest but still a baby.¬†    I was with a therapist whose process was throwing balls at people. We were outside on a field near some people playing catch. She threw the ball towards me. I nearly caught it but missed. I threw it back. We repeated this a few times. Then some other people walked onto the field. The therapist walked away from me and threw the ball sillily, strangely at Anna O. Anna laughed. I got jealous comparing the therapist's technique between us because I knew that Anna's sense of self was stronger than mine, and that was why the therapist was throwing the balls at Anna in a more ""advanced"" way, like Anna was beyond just catching and throwing. Then we were in an auditorium, and a black woman was in front speaking to us. She played the piano and sang. It was a song I had heard before. It was a protest song she and her classmates had sung during a protest when they were in school. As she paused I clapped immediately; I was the first to clap. Others clapped too. She continued the song but someone in the audience started playing piano in a different key. The woman stopped and asked her what she was doing. The woman in the audience said I'm accompanying you. She played her riff. It was in three and very loud. I couldn't tell if she was being malicious or earnestly messing up the key and time signature. The black woman continued and so did the other woman. The audience began clapping but with the piano part in three, like they were stating that they did not want to hear the black woman's song.¬†",,

I was with this big group of people that i recognized to be either from middle of high school. we were trying to go from point a to point b using the sidewalk of a massive, very busy road. almost like a highway. however, the sidewalk wasn't completely a sidewalk. there's a big hole in  every couple of steps with a thin piece wood in the middle of it acting as a bridge. for some reason, that piece of wood is very strong and we all managed to cross it. the hole was filled with this yellow liquid, it almost looked like soup??    2. same group if people but we're in a supermarket and we're playing paintball but with crossbows instead. the arrows had this suction at the end so when it's shot at someone it sticks to them no matter what the surface is. I was doing pretty well and it ended up with some of just taking stuffs and leave. there wasn't anyone watching us.     3. I think this is a continuation of the second one but I'm not sure. we all ended up outside on an empty street and this lady (slightly older than us but not that much) is giving us a lecture. I dont remember what it was about.     4. its night now and we're on the sidewalk trying to go somewhere. there are no holes anymore but it was covered with black scary looking dogs. some tried to make a run of it, but some of the dogs woke up, stood on their hind legs, and told us to just walk quietly past them. it was very weird.     5. my sister was in this one and I can't remember if it's the same group of people or not. we're sitting in a line and we're going given the result of an assignment? mine was an essay about fashion I think and I did very well. however, the instructor didn't know misspelled my name and they covered it with LAD for some reason. my sister's essay was about makeup and she did well too. the thing is, she got rewards for doing well including makeup freebies and a spa trip in a luxurious resort that I'm pretty sure was for 12 months. this in particular was very odd since neither of us is in this field in real life.

Several of my dreams were related to the pandemic.  1) I dreamt that I had a covid-positive baby to care for (in my job in the NICU) and was scared about my PPE failing to protect me. This morphed into a dream where I was 2) caring for a toddler whose entire body had broken out into a ugly purple rash. Then, 3) I dreamt that I had to perform CPR on a layperson - this person looked like a classmate from high school, but middle-school aged. I have not personally spoken to this individual in years. Anyways, it felt like I was doing chest compressions for what felt like an hour, with nobody coming to help or support me... in the end the person had a good outcome, but I did not witness return of spontaneous circulation in my dream. 4) Then, i dreamt that i was getting sick (covid?) In this scenario, I had parked my car in the parking lot to go grocery shopping. On my way out, I circled the lot x2, trying (and failing) to find my car. When I went to ask an attendant for help, I was losing my voice, my throat hurt, and my nose was getting stuffier with every second under my surgical mask. 5) Then, i found myself in a dream where I had ethnic black-type hair and was struggling to style and braid it for over an hour.",,

Another dream was a house party of sorts with a bunch of South Americans that I had just met (in my dream). There were 3 more distinct dreams that I can't recall now, but that were very vivid at the time.

One of the people got mad at us because we didn't tell her we were going up to order.     In the second, My family and I were going to my grandma's river house. Then my sister had to leave and he husband was going to drive the rest of us back in small car. My mom called a window seat so I was going to be stuck in the middle of the back row, which I was upset about because in my dream I thought I would get car sick.    In the third, my partner and I went to a restaurant. Everyone there was wearing shirts from my college. It was comforting I suppose, but also weird to be at a restaurant - not sure if lockdown was lifted or not.",,
12880L,"I had three dreams. One involved a fight that my mother and I had gotten into about her not wanting to go to my grandmother's house and her boyfriend killing a fish. My aunt wasn't speaking to my grandmother, so my mother didn't want to go to her house for some holiday dinner. My cousins might have still been going even though my aunt wasn't but my mom didn't want to go so I knocked a bunch of magnets and photographs down from her fridge. I immediately felt badly and started picking them up. I went with my grandmother out into the world to do something. I don't remember what, but we ended up in a huge snowstorm during the pandemic lockdown. We ended up going into a ""safehouse"", which was like a horror movie. The idea was to try to work through all of these rooms and escape, but it was a lot more intense and frightening than a normal escape room. At some point, we were up high in like a poolhouse bathroom/changing room in a warehouse sized bathroom/changing room. We were climbing on things to try to escape the water on the floor and some ghost-like creature with all things long, black, wet hair. While doing this, all of the lights came on and employees came in to make sure everyone was safe and hydrated and gave us water and checked on us. They explained that their goal was just to give people something safe and entertaining to do while we were stuck in lockdown and during the record breaking snowstorm and they reassured us that we were safe and in no actual danger. I also remember that when we were trying to get to the car at some point during the snowstorm and we had just gone into a shop minutes ago, we came back to the red sedan car and the snow had gotten so bad in a matter of minutes that the passenger side door was inaccessible from the three feet of snow that had piled up. The second dream involved the Wizard of Oz. I was running away from something and trying to escape. There were layers or levels of existence and there was a bad guy who had different appearances on different layers. Somehow the layer 2 version had gotten into layer 3, so the police force like group of people (some kind of castle guards or something) didn't recognize the actual bad guy? The bad guy was purple and rabbit-like or cat-like. The third dream involved some kind of augmented reality that was an alternative to living in the world after the pandemic. The main lady from Once Upon a Time who was also a doctor in House was in the dream. She told me and some other people that this augmented reality was different from the one I had experienced before because it was so immersive, you wouldn't know the difference and that this augmented reality was where everyone needed to go to stay safe and live a decent life. I think at the beginning of the dream, I was walking through the parking lot across from the VA where I work. I parked my Mustang and the lot was full and I noticed that no matter what the make of the cars were, they all had Mustang logos. I realized I was in some kind of augmented reality situation and I started naming the cars I could recognize and the program would ""render"" (I guess?) and update the cars to the correct logos and names. For example, I recognized a Ford F150 and said that outloud and it updated. There was another glitch where there was a row of weird half trucks and they were all labeled ""Pintos"". That's about all I can remember. All of the dreams were pretty unsettling, but not outright nightmares.",,

21955S,"I had three or four dreams last night, all of which involved very unrealistic/surreal scenarios, with many things happening in a chaotic manner.

6072L,"I had three vivid dreams last night. The first was an ABBA/1920's dream. I was in a mansion by the sea and all the lights had a soft glow. It was impossible to go outside, but the house was so large that didn't seem to matter to anyone. I was with a group of about 50 people and everyone was drinking and singing and dressed like the 1920 elite. The mom in my dream was not my actual mom, and she kept trying to get me to go out and entertain the guests by singing abba songs. I refused. My room had a pool and in the center was a floating piano bar with a mermaid trapped in it. She gave better advice than my mom. My boyfriend showed up and we started to walk about of the room. I wanted to stop walking out and he kept moving me. I repeatedly told him to stop and he just laughed. I started crying and we moved into a side room where he apologized and said he didn't know I was that serious about not walking out to sing abba. We left the room and he started forcing me to walk ""as a joke"" and I punched him. I said sorry and went into a closet alone, only the closet was a rainforest. Then the dream changed and I was riding my bike to my old house. It was windy and I had trouble opening the garage door to store my bike, but my sister came to help and we got it open and closed again quickly. The garage was cozy once the wind was blocked out. My sister said she had a surprise, so we opened the door to the backyard and her two dogs were outside! I was so happy. Two new dogs were there as well, and they instantly loved me. One was a red healer and the other was a cute mix of boxer and husky. We all sat down to take a picture in the wind and drool was everywhere but I had my sister's dogs on either side and the two new dogs laying in front of me. We were all very happy. Then the dream changed again. I was in my ex boyfriends apartment. His roommate was playing video games and my ex was talking to me as I was leaning over a sink cleaning my teeth with a small dirty mirror nailed to the wall. He was talking about some card game, but I wasn't listening because my teeth were a mess! I was so angry at my dentist for letting me walk around with my molars half out of their roots and two of my front teeth were filed down to tiny shards. My ex kept talking and I kept flossing and brushing and silently begging my teeth to stay put. Then I woke up. ",,
1415S,"I had three. One was me looking outside my door and seeing a ton of people crowding around on my street. I was really worried about it. Some came onto my porch. I was worried they'd try to get in, but they didn't, they just hung out on the porch. I was upset that they weren't following the shelter in place and it made me really worried about going back to work and sending my son back to day care.    Another was that I was in high school and we were going on a field trip to another school that was hosting a classic car show. We rode the bus there. I do remember wondering why it wasn't cancelled.    The last one involved a friend of mine from college who is relatively well known in his state's political community. He started publicizing stories about things I did when I was drunk in college. I tried to play it off like I didn't care and thought it was funny, but I was actually worried it would effect my career.",,

We decorated some shelves with big fake red roses but it wasn't allowed because the string crossed the aisles, and that was bad. There was also a very large man there. Like hagrid but not hagrid. Waffles featured prominently. I tried to find what I was calling everyday waffles, but I'm realizing now they are actually just homestyle eggo waffles and I found these frozen everything bagel waffles instead, which is gross. I spent a lot of time trying to find these waffles. then these two women in wheelchairs were looking at one of the freezers, and I thought i saw the everyday (aka homestyle) waffles, and they taught me this trick about keeping the freezer doors open. but then once they moved the box wasn't the everyday waffles, it was something else.

They had no pets and it appeared their entire home was a kitchen and family room.  Even looking at it from the outside, there was no space for anything else.  These were giant rooms and the architecture was exquisite Pacific NW Vancouver modern.  When speaking with friends, I mentioned the interior design easily could place this family in ""Architectural Digest"".  The man who owned it was rotund, slightly short, with one of those Lucifer closely shorn beards.  He did all the talking.  They had so many bicycles complete with architectural spaces carved outside for the bike racks, a bit like in the old days when homes would have horse tie ups attached to the house itself.  Everything was no expense spared there.  At one point, before starting my housesitting job, I texted the family to ask them not to set an alarm, since I never was given any instruction about a code.  I also asked if they had bike racks, but then realized they were very apparent, straddling the steps to the front door.

Then he told me COVID-19 had prompted researchers to determine genetic signatures of all physical anomalies.

Then we went to my temporary apartment to have a drink and dessert and i turned around and he was naked, and suddenly missing an arm from the elbow down. I was conflicted and I told him that I was up for it, but also not sure we should because I had a boyfriend (a real fact that had not been a part of the dream storyline until that moment).  He became furious that I would ever consider cheating on my boyfriend. When I asked him what about his wife, he told me they had split two days before, so he was ethically clear, but I wasn't.

I spent a lot of my time in that trip with another girl (who doesn't exist in real life) and we started to develop a friendship with some flirtatious vibes.    In my second dream, I wasn't in it. It was almost as if I was watching a movie, but I was watching it while in the body of the main character, seeing everything through her eyes. She was a woman who was being threatened to be killed by a very powerful mob and was inside the boss' house. It was huge and a lot of terrible things were happening everywhere: many people were being held hostage and being tortured. The mob boss had many adults and also small children working for him. The main character was trying to scape, and while sneaking around she found the boss' wife in a secret secluded area of the house. She wasn't involved in the mob and didn't know anything about it. The main character told her and showed her everything that was going on in the rest of the house, and she got very shocked and furious with all of it.

It was a long grill table with colorful vegetables and other good stuff piled on top. I am moving in real life too, which has been worrying me a bit, especially now during corona times. And one thing that I have been thinking about is how to move a large gardening furniture that is very very heavy and that I have potatoes planted in. In the dream, my friend told me to go and get some potatoes for the grill, and I said that they are probably not ready yet. Then she told me that her potatoes that she is growing are finished in 14 days.

I wanted to arrive early so that the IT team could test the video connection. I raced over to the room I was defending in and everyone was there except the internal/external examiner who was connecting online. I was surprised that they decided to hold it in-person. My external examiner had her hair cut short and did not smile as she looked at me. I knew the first line I would say in my presentation, but nothing past that. I felt comfortable that I would be able to give the presentation, as I had presented on my research many times before; but I was worried that without practice I wouldn't be very eloquent. Then I realized that I was wearing sunglasses, and that my glasses had a smudge. I wanted to go to my office to get my lens cloth. I asked if I had a couple of minutes, and my supervisor said yes. But as I left I heard the voice of my internal/external connecting over the video and I went back in. Do I have a minute? I asked. But everyone said I should start now. ",,

It was the staging area for firefighter training.    When Trump fired the Secretary of Defense, it led to Russian incursion on our soil.  We did not anticipate all the forest and brush fires ignited by the bombings; so out-of-work Americans were asked to apply to be sent to these drier regions to fight these pervasive blazes.    Regardless of our willingness or trepidation, every citizen was required to report to various stations.  If we accepted & donned a crimson red t-shirt with giant black block letters T A P on the front, we indicated we already were willing to apply for this work.    I arrived and was showing recently made friends around my old domicile (except there was a giant, domed, wooden cylindrical turret-like area in one part, reached by a narrow staircase along its walls, to best take in the water view).  At the top level, we could look out the small windows.  Someone there threw a t-shirt to me.  I put it on inside out to express I was not fully committed and only needed to be a little warmer.    Instantly, I received a text stating, ""You leave tonight on flight # (something).""  I was terrified and mad.  I had not applied, signed anything, and now the government expects me to start fighting fires in Montana or Kansas or Arizona.  What about my patients?  What about my apartment?  No!  Then I saw my old neighbor Michelle, the one whose husband starred on and started Deadliest Catch.  She wanted to see our basement.  She started to walk downstairs.  Suddenly, white smoke either was emanating from outdoors or inside the basement.  I could not determine the source.  Amid this chaos, I witnessed a man holding Michelle, carrying her nearly lifeless body up the basement stairs.  Once I realized the smoke was below us, I was too frightened to keep dreaming and awakened with a racing heart.",,

At one point, my cousin was broadcasting recent videos of my grandmother riding a bicycle like a wild woman.  She was 103 years old at the time.  IRL, she lived to 104.  I wanted to film the film with my phone camera, but when I pointed it at the screen, I realized I'd appear to be filming a domestic violence argument of neighbor.  Although the lake was across the street, things morphed and now the video was being projected onto a standing electrical box sitting inside a front yard.  Beyond it was a very irate neighbor, treating his wife in a frightening way.  I don't recall why I thought exposing him through recording a video was not the right thing to do and I could not capture my grandmother having fun on a bike.    The filmed action had passed; so my cousin rewound the tape and I simultaneously tried to alert the angry man to observe his actions in a more objective way.  Yet he was not rational and continued to threaten her with now the whole area watching.  We came together to whisk her to the safety of another yard.  Someone called the police and that is all I recall now.    A lot of this subject matter stems from glimpsing a LeBron James cartoon through the side of an airplane seatback in front of me, as well as watching the first two episodes of Mare of Easttown on my way back from Mexico.

Our tent is floating about calmly at a beach. I get outside the tent and stand on a rock triumphantly. I think to myself how beautiful the deep blue color of the water combined with warm grey rocks. I am happy and I hop around toward the shore. I suddenly remember that we are close to a conflict zone in the middle east. I stray a bit too far and see a glimpse of men hiding behind rocks. I don't think they saw me but I was perhaps only a few meters away from them. I run back to my group. They tell me maybe we can trust the US military to protect us.

I was really angry with my mom and I think I was throwing her belongings out of the apartment and down the hallway stairs to the building door.

Properties are large, with long gravel driveways over off-white & gray gritty sand.  I have a quiet neighbor and it's very dark outside as I arrive home by car.  There does not seem to be an available garage; because I find myself on quite a walk to the abode.  Somehow I end up on the neighbor's driveway.  It's creepy, so I start to jog warily to my place.  I feel his presence, but I cannot see him.    I fall and something lodges under my forearm, like a splinter of wood.  I absentmindedly pick at it as I stand up and hurriedly proceed home.  Whatever is lodged under my skin comes loose.  I pull & pull. It's most likely 18 inches long, with a flaring metal umbrella -frame end that opens and tears at me with its barbs.  Then I discover my neighbor lying on the ground.  There's been a private plane crash, but I don't feel he's the victim.  It feels staged.    I try to run, but he grabs my ankle.  I feel his parents, whom I think live there, are dead, and it's just the two of us.  He has a dog and it is moaning somewhere in the dark.  I scream and an IRL expulsion of a snore briefly awakens me.  It's too stressful and I stay awake awhile, reading a bit, then falling asleep to Chapter 4 of ""The Secret Garden"" on Insight Timer.  It does not work to allay this nightmare.  I am back and Jonathan is back, chasing me all over this small New England town.  There are two banks, one on the water and one across the street.  I feel as if I work at the latter, but I cannot remember the name of one bank versus the other.  It's a source of problems; because when I cry for help, everyone insists I provide the correct name.  Descriptions of locations, building features, etc. yield no response.  ""How can it be Jonathan who haunts your?  He's lived here forever.  We all know him.  You are new.""    Yet it is this Jonathan.  Even when other female's heads are mailed to various businesses, no one will listen to my pleas for help or ability to offer information of his whereabouts.  They all are repulsed and terrified by proxy, but I am constantly chased until I die.  And people are everywhere!  It's not as though no one hears me.    Often I am inside that bank, running up & down the back stairs to elude his persistent threat, hiding, yelling for help, with no response.  No one ever believes it is Jonathan.  After numerous encounters with him, I am exhausted and I awaken to the same heartbeat of a terrorized runner.",,

Plus, he's young and I am too old to teach a man an extra decade plus of life.  Mostly, my family spent centuries avoiding any act of war and I find it difficult to consider dating someone who chose a job that involved killing people. I understand, some people believe it's the only option, but not this guy.    During the Korean War, my father, although drafted, figured out how never to spend one night on the base.  Instead, he and my mother entertained their neighbors Salvador Dali & Jayne Mansfield in Greenwich Village.  I know, one should do one's part; but that meant killing people!    But I digress.  In my dream, this young man brought over some friends without asking.  I met them on the porch and he kept kidding me he was going to steal all my belongings from the garage.  IRL, the garage is a block away and there are no valuables there.  In my dream, the garage was next to the house and filled to the brim, except the spaces where the cars fit.  Leaving them outdoors, I ran inside, under the pretense of something else, & I grabbed my phone to use an app to close the garage door.    Then I found he'd brought someone to ""look at"" my car, which in the dream was malfunctioning.  We took it for a quick drive (in South Carolina now).  I thought I was showing him how it responded, then I found myself in the passenger seat.  It was unnerving; but this kid drove exactly the way I would, which is how I rationalized the shift of seats.  I kicked myself that I let this stranger drive my rarest automobile.  Simultaneously, we turned right on a swampy desolate road, only to be stuck behind a very slow gardening truck.    I'm pretty sure previously, in the dream, the guy who keeps asking for walks and I had sex, as if I was told by some societal maxim I must.  Now I was trying to extract myself from what he called a relationship.  IRL, I have operated under the ""I'm not ready for anyone"" train of thought and I continue to take it.  I have enough unease in my life at the moment.

Later, some Jason Statham-looking man kept trying to burst into my cottage-style one-story house.  He'd rush the exterior door and it would start to bend inwardly, although I knew it was locked.  I needed the throw all my weight against the door so many times!  He was relentless.  Then I noticed the kitchen had one of those 1970s pass-through areas with an outdoor yellow & brown tiled shelf/bar for moving kitchen dishes outdoors to the BBQ section against the house.  It was perennially open to the outdoors and I tried not to glance at it to give him the idea to enter via that threshold, since he easily could hop over the shelf and twist himself through the window to get inside.

There was a baby fawn there, and it couldn't get over the threshold so someone lifted it over the threshold so it could stay with them.    Scene: A kid who had no family and no where to go and no support was taken in by an older friend of mine. Her house is modern, clean, & organized, (like her house in real life) and the kid had accesss to a good education, and knitting supplies (the woman is a highly skilled knitter in real life.) I was talking to someone and commented that while this could be a great situation for some kids, the utter lack of warmth, affection, maternal behavior ect could be very problematic for a kid who came from an emotionally difficult or abusive situation who now needed love and support and a hug.    Scene: someone about going around a city. I didn't have to walk - perhaps I was floating. I was not flying, but I was in the air. This enabled me to get around better, and I learned how specific buildings & locations that I was familiar with were connected.

We did not start at the same time, as we were not racing against each other with one winner and one loser. There were many people. We went one at a time, and raced the clock (like in downhill skiing.) In order to get from the starting platform to the main area everyone had to go across monkey bars. On my first swing I started to skip two bars -something I could do as a kid (even in real life.) Since I had never been on these monkey bars before I was unfamiliar with the spacing and wasn't sure if my arms could reach that far.  I changed my mind and intended to skip only one bar, but by then my reaching arm was already past it. I had to swing back behind the original bar, hanging from one hand, and then only made it to the next bar. I knew I had just ""wasted"" time with the extra swing, plus didn't end up skipping any bars, which would put me behind my competitors. From there I really struggled to get accross the monkey bars because I was suddenly wearing wrist guards. (The kind I wore as a kid when roller blading.) The wrist guards had hard plastic from the inner arm up into the palm which caused my hand to bounce off the bar I was trying to grab, plus the wrist guard held my wrist in a flexed position which prevented me from being able to bend my wrist to grab the bar. This rendered it a nearly impossible task. At one point I was hanging from one hand and had completely twisted around and was facing backwards. With much difficulty I was finally able to cross the monkey bars in significantly more time than it had taken anyone else. Now I was in the main area, which was rather self contained, like a small island. There were tunnels, and slides. There was a task which would be much easier to draw than describe: there were different colored dots layed out in a pattern and simultaneously I was one of the dots and other people were also some of the dots. We had to start at ""our"" dot and draw a rectangle by connecting it to available dots. I moved and started to make my rectangle, only to realize there was no fourth dot to complete the rectangle in that location - which was in the lower left, away from all the other people. This meant I had to go towards the populated area up to the right where the dots were closer to gether and many were occupied by people. I would have preferred to stay out of the fray, but that was the only way to complete my rectangle. The next part of the challenge involved getting check ups by different kinds of doctors. There were many doors, which opened into long hallways, and at the end was a room with the Dr's office. You could not see the room or the Dr from the door. You just had to enter and hope it worked out. The strategy was to try to choose doctors that had the shortest waiting period. We were still racing the clock and the longer you had to stand in line and wait the more time you wasted. I went through the door and hallway for the optometrist. There was no line and the doctor was finishing with three people. While I waited for the Dr to finish with those three people, a long line formed behind me, and I was glad I had entered when I did. ",,
6378L,"I only remember one dream. I was skiing through a wooded area that wasn't frequented by other skiers. As usual I was just trying to keep up with my sister. I stopped to catch my breath when I hear music to my right. Two snowboarders burst through a cave in a powder explosion! They don't stick the landing but they're cheering as if they did. The cave must have been cool. I decide to keep skiing down the steep and lumpy powder filled slope to catch up with my sister. I make a left turn and as I swing my head round to stick out my right turn I see a dead body kind of obscured at the base of a lump. I decide that the lump is just a tree covered by a ton of snow. There was a lot of blood. All of this happened in an instant because I didn't stop. As soon as I registered the body, I had already completed my right turn and I was on my left. I was freaked out. I kept going because I knew the body was dead and there wasn't anything I could do to help. So I promise the poor body that I'll tell ski patrol and they can get it out. The rest of the way down the mountain wasn't fun, and the big jump before reaching the base wasn't satisfying but it looked super cool. I find ski patrol before my sister and I tell them where I saw the body. Ski patrol is super nonchalant and the guy said people keep telling them about it every few weeks but they can't find the body when they go to look. I feel pretty disgusted by ski patrol and tell myself to never die on the mountain. I go to look for my sister and I still can't find her. After what felt like a few hours I conclude that she left with her guy friends. I find my old scientist friends, that apparently I have, and they invite me to dinner at their lodge. The table sat about 8 people and we all tucked in to countless dishes of corn. I ate a corn pudding but politely refused the rest. The guy to my right was eating as much corn as he could, it was fascinating to watch. The scientists serve corn free wine and I'm so thankful for something other than corn that I finish a bottle by myself. I tell the table about the dead body I saw earlier and one of the scientists slams a button on the table and the whole table with all the guests shoot down into an underground lab. There are tanks filled with blue bubbling water all along the walls. I look closer at one of the blue tanks and corn is inside. It looks slimy and wrong. The scientists tell me that the body I saw belonged to a spy that had been brutally murdered. I don't feel surprised. The scientists then tell me that I have to go back and try to catch the group that killed the person at night. That seems to make sense to me, but I tell them that the terrain is difficult and the only person that could ski that is my sister. The scientists don't seem happy about that but they agree and give me a friend to help me go find my sister. He's a damn attractive spy guy that had been standing in the shadows during dinner. I agree to take him with me. Then the dream got confusing because suddenly I was applying to office jobs with my hot sidekick spy. I go to scope out one office and immediately get stuck sorting files into a system that makes absolutely no sense. When I tell a coworker the system is broken, she tells me I'm just the most stupid person to have ever existed and to keep filing to make up for it. I feel like I could die there, endlessly sorting files that no one cares about into a system that was made by the devil. I ask my spy if we're dead. He says no, but we found a lead. I grab a coworkers keys and run for the garage like my life depended on it and we leave the office behind in a truck. It's night and we pull into the parking lot of a diner. For some reason we have guns. We cut the lights to the diner and start searching with flashlights for my sister. Three hooligans appear in the back, but I can't make out their faces. Two of them look like the snowboarders who blasted music and rode through the cave by the body. I question them and the third escapes through a window. I give chase. We're running through a field of flowers and the moon was bright enough to make out the colors of each flower. I know the person I'm chasing is my sister. I wonder why I'm chasing her and we're on different sides of a mysterious battle. She stops running and I cut two flowers for her. I hand them to her and tell her I love her and I'll be the one to ski and recover the body. She seems sad but hands me a bulletproof vest to wear and warns me of the scientists. My hot spy agrees with her and they both tell me not to go, but I have to see this through and they respect that. I drive alone to my old college town to meet a friend at a hockey game. I don't see him in the crowd, so I sit alone and watch the game. Eventually the game ends and everyone filters out until I see my friend across the ice and it's just the two of us. We put on skates and skate around and he tells me about the scientists and how their own people went awol and killed their own agents. He tells me that there is no rival group because it's the same group. I'm disturbed again because I don't know why I'm involved. We skate for awhile longer and it's fun. I drive the truck back to the scientists lodge and my brother is there and tells me there's something I need to see. We walk in and are greeted by a horrible slimy corn monster! It starts speaking and I finally realize that it's the man that had sat next to me at dinner who couldn't stop eating corn. The corn man tells me that the scientists turned him into a corn monster and the same will happen to me eventually. He said the members who turned against their own group did so because they didn't agree with turning people into corn monsters. The dead body I found was one of the top scientists who filled his body with antibodies and could save all the corn people. But the evil scientists didn't like that so they had him killed. They wanted to kill anyone who had the ski skills to reach the body. I start to panic because I do not want to be a corn monster. I practically throw on my skis and make my way to the mountain. The hot spy says he'll love me even if I turn into a corn monster and I tell him he's insane. He agrees and I appreciate him for it. I tell him it won't work between us, but if he ever does some cool spy adventures to count me in. He drives off in the truck. I make my way to the lift and I can already feel my body turning into corn. I'm thankful for the bullet proof vest keeping my corn in. I'm on the lift and start to freeze because I forgot to wear a coat....and then I woke up. ",,

Besides the two black and grey cats that belonged to the owner, there was an orange cat there as well. I checked the windows. They were open; cats could come in and out. I guessed that was okay. I didn't know if this orange cat was a stray cat or belonged to the house. Steve was with me and we were talking. I went to the bathroom and looked in. Deborah was coming out of the shower. Oh, I said, I'm sorry; I didn't know you were home! She might have said she came back early. I left and wondered whether I said anything to Steve in the kitchen was anything I wouldn't have wanted her to overhear from the bathroom.¬†    Steve and I and one other person (Chris?) were at an event at night, either performing or watching. We were supposed to have been getting busses back, but it was getting very late. I looked at the time and thought I would try to make the last bus. I forget what Steve and Chris were doing that they weren't coming with me. I ran through the building. As I ran there was a train that ran alongside me before I exited. I nearly crossed the tracks as it came but averted getting run over. I ran outside and there was a man walking with a rolling suitcase who I assumed was also going to the bus and who I overtook. As I crossed the street to the bus stop, I saw the bus pull out. I tried running into the street and flailing my arms but it was too late; it was too far gone to see me and stop. I walked to the bus stop which was in a parking lot. A car pulled up behind me to exit the lot. The car was full with a family and the man with the suitcase was in the back seat. I guess he hadn't been going to the bus stop after all. I called Steve and told him I missed the bus. I said it was the last one until morning. I was hoping he would come to pick me up. He said something about the ticket, like maybe I could alter it. I repeated that that was the last bus and I would rather walk home than wait all night in the parking lot.¬†    Jac was sitting in the bathroom in a green robe which she pulled open. She said that she had been walking down the stairs when some of her pubes got caught and tore off, and had that ever happened to me? I said augghh that sounds awful!! No that's never happened to me! As we talked we walked into my room. Hayley was there. She pointed to something on my shelf and said ""salad."" I looked and it was a picture of a bowl of jelly beans on a book spine. I vaguely assented. I picked up a can of seltzer and was surprised to see it half empty. I was staring into it and Jac asked what I was looking at. I said oh, I didn't realize that this can was open a little bit, so a lot of the water evaporated.¬†    I was packing boxes of items to resell with my fictitious dream family. We got the items wholesale and resold it at a profit. Things like Vaseline and diapers. I think we were working for a drug lord. My brother was sitting at the kitchen counter when the drug lord came in and took out my brother's penis. He very quickly raped him somehow. The drug lord left and my mother came in. She saw my brother but didn't say anything. She had boxes of products in her arms. I knew we were short on money and that was why we were doing this. I took my little sister (maybe 4 or 5 years old) to entertain the drug lord and his friends for money, without my mother's permission. She was dressed up in traditional Japanese or Korean dress and was dancing around the middle of a room. I knew it was sexual somehow for the men but I didn't know how. In the middle of the dance my sister got very animated. I noticed her face looked different, then I realized that they (the movie directors) got an actor, an older man who is tiny and looks young, to play my sister because it was too much for such a young child to perform this part. She turned back into my sister and stuck out her foot for me to kiss. There was a small traditional antique sword attached to her foot, which I removed to kiss it. The sword was small and silver and had a curvy blade. While I kissed her foot, one of the drug lord's friends took the sword from me and drove it into my sister's stomach. No! I said. I looked at the drug lord, waiting for him to say that that wasn't allowed for this one. He didn't. I couldn't bear to watch so I hid behind a curtain. By this point I was watching everything, including me, like a movie. They were performing some sort of ceremony. My sister started singing a song. I looked through the curtain and saw that my sister was still alive. I called out to her. She didn't show any signs of distress. I thought about bringing her to the hospital but for some reason knew that I could not. At the very end of the dream, I thought about driving the sword deeper to kill her, and I just started to when I woke up.¬†",,

The beds were unmade and messy, and there were things on the chairs so it seemed like nothing was prepared for us to be there, or they really didn't care (which would be very out of the norm for Mormon missionaries we know in real life).

Then he turns to me and asks, ""Would you like to come with us?""  He's well known in the community (whoever he is) and I readily accept his invitation.  To sail feels as if I had been a prisoner suddenly paroled.  It is liberating!  A little later, we all find ourselves inside a doctor's exam room.  My best friend from the womb, Linda, also is present.  Instead of the usual sterile white environment, the walls are made of vertical planks of medium brown wood from times past.  We talk of swimming and plan a future gathering to swim in salt water when the weather warms.  I ask Linda the name of her community swim complex in her childhood neighborhood.  My visual memory of it in the dream is entirely different than how it truly appeared way back when.  It is more magnificent in the dream, with many different swim area options for exercise and fun.  She tells me it was called the Mike Brown Center.  I think I awakened then.  It was 7:24.  I do not know a Mike Brown, other than a history teacher in high school.  Come to think of it, he did have curly blond hair and was quite sporty.  I haven't thought of him in ages.  The second dream occurs next. I recall it takes place on a drive home.  I am driving alone and I turn left down a dead-end road, which is one block earlier than my intended route. There are two homeless, young, drug-addled folks walking down the street in front of me.  They are carrying loaded unwashed backpacks.  I realize we both will reach the cul-de-sac simultaneously.  They address me, since my window is down and suddenly we are walking inside an arcade (not the gamer type).  The woman asks if my necklace is real as she grasps it as we reach the mostly glass door to the street.  It is a necklace I do not own in real life, a delicate gold necklace with a small pearl about every quarter inch along it.  I tell her I only wear fakes, because of the vastly increased  crime after the pandemic.  I try to prove to her it holds no value; but she does not listen.  She rips it from my neck.  Then she starts to fondle my fake pearl earrings.  I tell her I bought them for $8 on Amazon (I really do own these earrings.)  Then we are outside, next to a large 1940s plate-glass store window, and I see her hands and she has all my mother's diamond rings.  I cannot fathom why I wore all this jewelry that day.

A very weird sex dream with someone I met 4 years ago during a summer internship, and who I've reconnected a bit with on social media  3. I went on a very fancy date with a guy I used to like a year ago. After he pays the expensive tab, he sprints to the exit and I see my entire family sitting on another table at the restaurant. So I sit down with them. Suddenly the venue is getting prepped to become a bar/place to dance at night. So I decide to stay there and party with my family.  A line was beginning to form at the entrance. Meanwhile the guy I went on the date with was waiting for me at a Dunkin Donuts next door, but I chose not to see him for the rest of the night.",,

Came upon a children's soccer game where all my immediate and extended family was watching. I stopped and hung out with them instead of going where I was going.    In the next dream I was walking through a suburban neighborhood with someone else when a person came running out of a house with a knife and stabbed a guy to death in front of us. They held us as prisoners in the house for weeks, subjecting us to pain and torture. We managed to break free and headed for the door but the person found us. They stabbed themselves in the chest and dyed, then their boss came in, who we'd never met. Can't remember if he let us go or what happened next.

Then we went to a large track and field stadium where we found a stray puppy. My family initially wanted to leave it, but the puppy followed us and my cousin adopted it. In my second dream, I was at my town's library but I had forgotten to wear my mask. My two best friends from my study abroad program surprised me at the library after traveling to see me, but I was a little stressed about their visit because I had a test the next day. In my third dream, I dreamt of the two people, John and Valerie, who I had recently interviewed with for a job.

In another dream, I was at my family's lake house and a good friend (who is also a terrible houseguest) called me to ask if he could come.

On that bench there were people I know and I don't really feel comfortable with (like some co-workers or ex university colleagues). They were sitting very close to eachother because they were too many and they wouldn't fit the bench. I was awkward and wanted to be as less visible as possible. Then I accidently tripped and I had a candle in my hand. The candle wasn't burning but had the warm wax that usually is around the flame. So I tripped and the candle landed on one of my co-worker's knee. And he was angry. I was feeling sorry and terrible thinking the wax is going to stain his jeans. Happily there was no wax on his knee and he said ""it's ok"". But I wanted to tell him ""you're an asshole"".  I didn't.   Then I don't know what happened. I remember I was eating a kebab with my best friend. But the kebab had a lot of colorful vegetables and was really really tasty. I remember very well the color and the taste.. And she was telling me that she is sorry she doubted how good the kebab will be. And I was telling her that I knew she will like it. And we were feeling very comfortable and laughing.. ",,

I asked her if she wanted me to go in her house and use the toaster to cook our frozen fish.  I went into the house and there were strangers inside.

In one we (me, my husband, others?) were attempting to get somewhere and it involved some rock climbing (no ropes, just scrambling) that we were only somewhat successful with. I lost my grip a few times and kept trying.  Another dream was in a theater. We had organized an event and hired a comedian but the audience was so sparse due to social distancing that the whole mood was lacking. The comedian was at some point doing an aerialist thing and I joined in. She was in a white and pink floral costume and spinning in the air over the stage. I surprised her when I was also there, suspended. But adjusted the act to accomodate my appearance. After the performance, all the people who had been in the audience were much more impressed with the incredible job that the custodial woman was doing. Everyone was oooooing and aahhhing over her cleaning cart and remarking about the excellence of her supplies and that she was instructing people in so many places so well.  In the third dream we (me and my husband?) were standing on a bridge talking to someone on a fairly large sailboat. I was staring mostly at the navy blue plastic mesh that covered the hull. He had waited too long and couldn't get out of the channel and out to sea. He said he would have to wait for the tide. Then someone on the bank said, ""Or not."" Just then the boat rose higher and moved fast away from us. The person on the bank said, ""The whales sometimes just do that. They seem to love it. But you never know where the ride will end.""  In the fourth dream we (me and my husband) were walking on a path through some woods and came to a clearing. On one side was a high school building. On the other side it was just a rock cliff and lots of growth. It seemed really damp and overgrown. I saw an animal from quite a distance and asked my husband if he could see it, and what was it; a giant alligator? As we got closer I could see that it was a giant hippopotamus. It was gray and covered in moss and lichens. It was huge. Maybe 10 times larger than a large hippo. We watched it as it went over to the rock cliff and took it's place within the face of the granite cliff. If we hadn't watched it move into place and kept an eye on it's eye we would never have noticed it. It blended in perfectly. As soon as we were with others, starting with someone in the family, I asked if anyone knew about the hippo but whoever I asked had no idea. ",,

But then again, one of the batters was a chihuahua, so I guess we could give it the benefit of the doubt!  I also remember walking downstairs in what was effectively my house but the stairs were a dirt path switch back, like a hiking trail. There were bits of food along the trail, like someone had dropped bits of carrot and red peppers out of their lunch box.

Then there was a lot of trudging through muddy fields, drinking tequila and repeatedly moving house. Finally one girl fell for another girl, got rejected, and then her eyes went bloodshot and she tore her own heart out of her chest. They poured the blood over the other girl, who shriveled up and burst into flames. Then a weirdly muscular boy appeared as the Messiah.

I remember everything was dry and dusty and light brown. I was on the run and I had to go somewhere, to a sea and then return. To do that I had to follow the trace of an old river that was long time dried and looked like a pathway. I ended up somewhere in a town or something. There was no desert anymore and it wasn't so hot. It was night and I was on the street, next to a lightning pole. Someone was hiding and appearing behind that lightening pole trying to talk to be but I couldn't concentrate because on the sky there was a magnificent display of stars. It was so beautiful.. unlike anything I've ever seen. And then the stars started moving in an intricate and fascinating ""dance"". It was like a kaleidoscope of stars dancing on a dark sky. I was thinking ""how is this possible? does it have something to do with the water?"" and then I saw like a map on Google Maps that I was zooming in and out trying to calculate the distance from where I was to this town and the position of everything on the map. It was somewhere in Africa but I couldn't realize what part of Africa so I gave up and had to return to the desert. I don't remember returning - just thinking it is time to go.     Second dream was by the side of a pool. I was with my friends. It was hot outside and the water was cold. I didn't want to enter the pool but they convinced me to do it. I remember the cold cold water on my skin and it was very pleasant. I was happy the water is not deep and I looked down to my feet. I realized the water was crystal clear and the bottom was made of large crystals like diamonds, reflecting the sunlight in beautiful sparklings. It was very very beautiful. So I started floating on the water and it was nice. Then one of my friends came to me and said I have to meet her friends. And she started pulling me to the side of the pool, while I was still floating. I was smiling because I like it when someone pulls me like this. On the side of the pool there were two acquaintances and we made small talk. I laughed that their hair grew chaotic due to quarantine. Then it was evening. I was outside the pool, with these two acquaintances. The water was ""greenish"". They were showing me the ladders they built for the pool. One ladder was short, just at the surface. The other one was going deeper underwater. They asked if I want to try them. But I didn't like the water color and I said I don't want to do it. We then started discussing technical stuff about the designing of the ladders. I was thinking I am happy we all finished the same specialization and it is nice to have someone to talk stuff about.

It was a video of me hip hop dancing at a talent show in middle school and we couldn't get it to pause or get off the screen. I was embarrassed and also thought it was really funny. There was also a part of my dream where a friend and I were watching a movie, and twice in the movie a character cried out, ""social distancing!"" and our jaws dropped.

But then the car came around in front of us and blocked us nose to nose, and we realized it was a police car, pulling us over. We were just sort of wandering around this parking lot slowly until this point. I was trying to figure out why we were being pulled over and realized it was probably because I was eating something out of a bowl the other woman was holding and I was using chopsticks to eat it. I was pretty sure the police officer was going to say eating with chopsticks while driving was not safe and I was prepared to show him how I am very good with chopsticks and can pick things up without even looking.

Then I mixed her up with some other friends of my family, and the girl in that family that is in my age, she has two siblings, and they are alive. And I was a bit confused.

For a bit I stayed in the restaurant section looking at the menu (which included various cutesy deserts (flans?) and molded rice Teddy bears (which I've only ever seen in photos, usually from BuzzFeed)) before I went to the back. Our party were the only customers, there were also 3 women working in the restaurant. My husband/ex-husband was playing a basketball game and he might have won a small prize.

The guide was good at his job, he rowed with one paddle and went over fallen logs in a way that wasn't jarring. I was sitting in the front of the boat with him. At one point I lost my ring (which is odd since I don't wear rings) and he somehow saw where it fell and was able to scoop it up. For some reason something went Wrong and our journey was interrupted. The guide took us to his apartment to regroup. He told me to look away from one of his roommates, and to not look at him. So, of course bi had to look at him. One of his roommates was an ex boyfriend that had a pretty rough breakup with me. He saw me, looked pissed, and eventually greeted me by saying ""well hi there ya dumb bitch"".

I was able to fight him off, and ended up bringing him to the hospital because he was injured (but I don't think from me? Or maybe?). Another girl was in the hospital and really sick, (and they happened to be someone I went to high school with and haven't interacted with for over 10 years) and at the end of the dream I kind of left the person who I was in the dream, and had a perspective of looking over everyone and everything and I saw a comparison someone made between the person who I was before and the girl that was already attacked (both red/blond hair and I'm a brunette so that's weird), and they were saying it looks like the same guy accidentally attacked the other very injured girls go was there, thinking she was the person who I had the perspective of in the dream, but then it looks like he found the other girl/(me?) too.

I spoke with a guy who might also have had powers but didn't see the need for concealment, as he scheduled an event for me with such a quick turnaround (under half an hour from my start time) that his email invite was more announcement than a true invite; it irked me. I was in a store where I knew I needed to leave early rather than later to get home so I could have the meeting in the morning. I spoke with a woman who worked there as she held a very small, fairly squirmy kitten who moved in her hands like a slinky before she put him in a cardboard box with indented cups as though made to hold many small plants. I knew there was something bad/evil about the store clerk, but I needed to escape quickly, without making a scene. Once outside, I saw two friends (who don't live in the same household) eagerly walking towards me on the sidewalk (standing right next to each other, no social distancing) to go to a movie together. I was jealous, both because their get together didn't include me, but also because I couldn't go even if I had been included (I think part of my shock to see them going to see a movie is because: 1) all theaters are closed, 2) not social distancing). I had a premonition of one of them making a post about their outing, and wishing I could have been part of that. I went back home (not anywhere I've lived IRL), and I was in a walk-in closet with a young boy who had been captured by the bad guys; in coloring and build he somewhat resembled but was not Harry Potter (last night I saw photos of a college friend's son dressed up as Harry Potter for Halloween, but this boy was not her son). I somehow left but could not take the boy with me. I was in the house and two bad guys were there, holding my family hostage. I went to one bathroom (the floor plan resembled an older-fashioned detective's office or newsroom, with stained wood doors and somewhat opaque class that ripples), peeked open the door, and saw one bad guy. He was holding a set of delicate, bulbous glass things that I somehow knew were very important, and was taking them one at a time, and squeezing in hen and flushing them down the toilet. I felt frantic, but somehow he either didn't see me, or couldn't come after me unless he finished his task first. I went to the other, adjacent bathroom, and saw the other bad guy at work on a similar task. To my horror as I opened the second door wider, the two rooms were now connected, and I could see the first bad guy too, and they were both laughing at me, triumphant (both bad guys were wearing maroon coats, which the military characters all wore in the production of Much Ado About Nothing I watched last night).

My co-teacher and I each took one of the visitors, I was mostly working with the little girl, and had the impression that she was loved by her too busy parents, but that she was too used to having to do things on her own. After she'd gone I was in the hallway with the visiting woman and I didn't know the school well enough to know the names of the other teachers on my floor, I asked one of the teachers to come to the door and asked the other teacher to introduce herself to the visiting woman to try to cover my lack of knowledge, but it was clear why I did it, and as we walked back down the hallway I tried to explain it was being because I was new.  The scene changed and I was driving to work (not the way I drive to work IRL) up and down a very hilly road I knew to be near a lake. I came to a point where there were huge trees growing in the middle of the street, I had to climb over and through their huge root structures that stuck out of the ground by about 10-12 feet and pick up my car on the other side. It felt like an enormous inconvenience but it wasn't overly unexpected.  The scene changed, I was walking through these deep sand dunes (a tourist attraction?) and passed some other people but I was trying to keep my distance from them (√† la social distancing). At times the sand came up to my chest but the sand wasn't heavy. As I began to crest the sand dunes hill I was then inside and two older women (perhaps in their 60s-70s+) were telling me about getting clean and getting ready the sand off, which for some reason involved using a bidet before the shower.

They were trying to catch a ""jelly killer"", but every time they got close to catching him he slipped away ""like jelly"". Finally they got a tip that the killer was in an abandoned house, so they rush over and end up chasing a guy through a gorgeous garden. The jelly killer escaped. I stopped being an observer and the season changed to fall. I was walking through a neighborhood filled with herb gardens and talking to a squat and shifty reporter guy. He asked questions about the jelly killer that only the killer would know, so I call the police and they hunt him back down to the abandoned building. The garden is dead. They catch the guy and Jake and Amy go up to the highest point of the building to look at the view, but then Amy dies somehow.  So Rosa and Jake go on a detective rampage and I'm interviewing a reporter woman who reminds me of a mix of Rita skeeter and Umbridge from Harry Potter. So the reporter woman is horrible and tells lies. I get that dread feeling where I know how this is going to go: the horrible woman is lying and I know that to my core but no one will believe me. That doesn't happen tho! I tell Jake and Rosa and they believe me that she's lying. So we set up an elaborate plan to catch her in a park bathroom late at night. Jake speeds along the highway on one of those electric skateboard things which seemed really dangerous but then Rosa drops down onto the highway from the car she converted into a helicopter! Jake felt shown up but still in good spirits. I asked him how he could be so cheerful when his wife was dead and he said he had purpose. We arrive at the bathrooms and beat the crap out of the horrible woman after we catch her hiding in a stall waiting for us. Something didn't add up though, so Jake runs through the evidence and we discover that only an insider on the force could have known how to kill Amy. That's when Duntch (Dentch?) appears from the other stall and she lunges for some incriminating evidence and tries to flush it down the toilet. I smash the toilet to pieces to stop it flushing and Rosa grabs Duntch who says she regrets nothing. The air is cold and everything is in shades of brown or gray outside. Jake finds a note from Amy and I don't know what it said. The horrible woman was a pawn in Duntch's plan, however she gets charged with helping Duntch and the jelly killer, and still gets put in the back of the police car.

3579L,I was at a family home with extended and immediate family members. We were told that the house had been sold and that we needed to leave.,,
16430L,"I was at a family reunion but I didn't know the family very well. They were very competitive and we were playing a bunch of games. One involved a lot of swimming in a pool and the organizers were such sticklers for the rules to the point where it was really unfair and not fun at all. Then I was sitting on the side of the pool and I had a baby. I didn't even know I was pregnant. I was so surprised and scared. But I kept wanting to play the scavenger hunt game thing so I strapped the baby to my front and started swimming around to the different stations. I finished a few games and then they called the halftime break, so I swam back to my station where I was hanging out with my towel and stuff. My baby wasn't breathing, so I did infant CPR and it started breathing again.  I was so far behind everyone else that I decided to skip the rest of the game and go back to my cabin. I texted my cousin that I had had sex with the previous week during the family reunion (but like...this cousin was black and i'm white, and it's not even a real cousin that I have in real life) and told him that I had a baby, assuming he would know the baby was his. Also notable is that in this dream I am in a relationship with my current real life actual boyfriend that I have been dating for 1.5 years. I also texted someone else that night before going to bed, telling them something about my 20 month old baby. In the morning (still in my dream) I woke up. I thought ""damn, that was a crazy dream last night, I had a baby??!!"" but then I checked my phone and saw the very real texts that I had sent to two different guys, neither of whom was my actual boyfriend. At this point I was convinced I had actually had a baby. I was so paranoid that I would have to tell my boyfriend that I had cheated on him and had a baby with another person, but then I counted back the months and realized I would have had to get pregnant in February, which was way before the family reunion and when I was only sleeping with my boyfriend. (also notable, in real life I have not actually cheated on my boyfriend, but last night I was listening to a podcast about cheating) I realized this was when I got my IUD changed out so I might have gotten pregnant then. I also realized the baby was extremely pale, so there was no way my black cousin was the father. A few scenes followed: at one point I was speaking with my family and they referred to my baby but didn't know the name - the Vietnamese girl standing next to me (literally just a random Vietnamese girl, not anyone I know in real life) said her name was Happy and I thought about it and said okay. But I thought ""her? I'm not even sure the gender of my baby"" so I tried to look at my baby's sex organs but I couldn't tell if it had a penis or a vagina.   At one point I was in the car with my parents and my grandparents (the baby wasn't there) and I was explaining to them how it wasn't my fault, I wasn't being irresponsible. I had to change my IUD and during the first month after the new IUD we were using alternative methods of birth control, condoms, but something must have failed. I have been having regular periods as well, so nothing tipped me off to the fact that I was pregnant. I was frantically explaining to them why they shouldn't be mad at me but they didn't seem mad at all. Neither mad nor happy, just kind of like neutral.   At one point I was thinking about how the father of the child (which I still didn't register was probably my own boyfriend) would be able to babysit while I went out and did the rest of my life. I was really upset at myself and the baby as I kept realizing that you can't just leave a baby alone. You have to take care of it always. You can't just set it down and let it take care of itself.   I kept analyzing how I got pregnant and was thinking back to how I had been loosing weight recently and I'm really quite skinny, and there's no way that I could have been pregnant. Also, how did I just pop out the baby while squatting on the side of the pool, without any pain? Also, there's no way that I  cheated on my boyfriend, I really like him and don't want to do that. At this point I think I realized I was dreaming and woke up. ",,

I chatted with a woman who was surprised that I was single and thus staying all alone in my hotel room; she was in the same boat, so we made plans to go down too the hotel restaurant and eat together (this feels like it's based on me self-isolating IRL in my apartment, where I live alone).  Time passed and I think I might have been staying at the same hotel for some reason. Fewer people were wearing masks. I took a shower at the hotel before going to some friends' baby shower, and as I left my room I saw some people by the elevator who weren't wearing masks, including someone from work IRL holding a toddler (IRL his kids are in their early-mid 20s, and don't have kids) which reminded me to put my mask on because I was around people again. I felt guilty about having left my room unmasked; it felt like having had the opportunity to relax and get cleaned up earlier in the evening made me forget that the mask is an essential accessory whenever you're not alone. It was nighttime as I walked up a steep-ish hill to the restaurant where the baby shower was being held and saw signs announcing that it was a girl, and I thought that that was odd to announce before we walked in the door (also, the baby shower was for two friends IRL who had their son about 10 weeks ago and their baby shower was midday, not at night). I saw Alan Cumming at the sign in area for the baby shower holding a gift. At that moment I wasn't sure if I'd brought a gift but hoped that when it came to it that I'd be able to look down and see a gift bag in my hand. I saw the same woman who earlier in the dream had been surprised that I was single and felt a bit sad that that was still the case, months later.

She was one of the characters on Orange is the New Black. ",,

I looked the masks over- some were clear plastic masks that covered the whole face except the eyes, much like a Halloween mask. I put three of those masks (one for each member of my family) into my purse, along with three paper face masks. I left the N95s (at least if I'm a thief in my dreams I'm a conscientious thief, haha) and walked out. From there I drove a car the wrong way on a freeway, trying to avoid other cars and not crash because there were Teslas on the road and I didn't want to crash into an expensive car (??).",,

Meanwhile, somebody needed their arm amputated, so I pulled up some info on my phone but then the people working on that were like, ""okay, what next, she passed out??"" And I was trying to balance repressing my work and helping them. An old high school friend appeared and I made him take over some ibuprofen (cause that's gonna help?!) and start looking stuff up about how to finish off an amputation (sewing it shut, etc)",,

Probst was trying to get us to buy a horse so we each stood behind one in the stable. Mine was a dog but he kept insisting it was a horse. Then Jeff started playing hip hop music videos on a huge projector and I really wanted to leave so I packed up and walked out. He said ""these are my favorite things to watch while wearing a mask.""    After I left I joined a beginner's women's lacrosse team and started training and learning how to play. It was pretty fun.",,

I could see a wave of pure cold approaching, in the shape of a rotating storm cycle, and it hovered right above me, with the ice crystals frozen in mid-air. Thus began a very, very long process to get home, that was stressful and went on for a very long time. First we tried to go home in my uncle's car, then we spent a long time in the parking garage trying to find his car. During the drive my mom and I got in an argument about Carthage, and then conveniently passed a roadside museum about Carthage, run by an older, well-dressed Romanian scholar, where we were able to hash out the debate. In the dream I was talking about Cato the Elder and his famous ""Cartago Delendo Est"" speeches, and even in the dream I had the quote right. Later we had to switch into an Uber, which we were sharing with contentious strangers. When we finally arrived at our destination, I had so much luggage I kept having to go back for more and more trips. I had packed kitchenware, dishes, a blender, and I couldn't carry it all.",,
26909S,I was at a store with my mother that was maybe Costco. I was going to buy some pant. I wanted whitish long pants but they only had shorts except for a pair that was kinda dressy but needed to be finished by a tailor. Strange for a Costco it was like an old fashion store where the stock is behind the counter and you ask for things. Even though the pants were too dressy and unfinished I liked them because the fabric was neat and they had designs of paintings on them with neat subtle colors. I was going to buy them. I also had a way too expensive wine. I meet a young worker I knew and we walked out together in the process I didn't pay for an expensive item. It was shoplifting but I didn't bother taking it back. When I got to car my mother and others were there sorta camping at car. A young (sister?) was there and had been sipping wine I had bought earlier. We all went back to lobby and now it was the place I used to work. I asked if my family could use bathroom and a former work friend said they could use lobby bathroom. ,,
20862L,"I was at a subway station and there were little shops there. I went in and had a craving for peach yogurt. I saw an unrefrigerated one on display so I looked for the refigerated ones. I saw a case of yogurt but the peach flavor was in a bucket like a self serve buffet. I took some yogurt and also some blue corn tortilla chips. Then I went to Kiera's house. I knocked and went in and there didn't seem to be anyone home. Their house was small and messy even though they had just moved into a bigger house. Maybe what I was seeing was a combination of their new house and what I imagined their old apartment to be. I found the whole family in a room in the back all sitting on the floor. ""Hi,"" I said, and they looked up startled. I said I knocked but they said they didn't hear me. I sat with Kiera's young son and picked up a book and read it to him. It was filled with art by Kiera or her friends. I stopped at a page with a blue thing made of feathers. I pointed at it and said ""if you could invent anything, what would it be?"" Then I realized the thing was supposed to be a condom, but I pretended I didn't notice and figured he wouldn't know what a condom was anyway. Then me and Kiera and Jesse were walking outside, back to their house. I asked her how she was and how teaching was and she seemed annoyed or upset. She told me about her homeless refugee students. Then Jesse and I lost her when she went ahead of us. We crossed the street but then saw her on the other side. We decided to go around the block and meet her at the other end. Jesse asked me how things were going. I said good, and I had just finished my PhD and got a certificate. And that I was a research fellow. Then we were all back at the train station and I said I was going to pick up my things I had put on hold because the ice cream store was closing to the public for a birthday party. Then we went through a big trash chute which Jesse helped me to go down, to get through the train station.   Then maybe a separate dream: I was in a house with Max C. and Chelsea. They went out onto the porch and were wearing masks and talking. I tried making dinner. There was a full length mirror in the kitchen and I looked at my butt in my new pants. It looked weird and I tried to adjust my clothes. I wanted Max to be attracted to me still. I went outside and found Raspy and picked him up and decided to take him home and keep him inside in case he ran away into the neighborhood. He was Kiera's cat and I was going back to her house. ",,

A boy (preteen or early teens) was on the ride, and he showed me where to take the fork. I knew I had to take it but didn't want to, I dreaded it. Unlike the channel I'd been taking before where the water moved you quickly and you got dunked or showered with water, the second fork had the water barely moving, it was like a lazy river except I was walking through the shallow (mid-calf vs. the earlier mid-chest) water. On the deck next to the water there was an old man in at least his older middle age either standing or in a chair there, and I needed to convince him to let me get approved to go on the plane. I was scared, I felt like he was going to make me do something I didn't want to do (I was reading about the Tara Reid accusations last night).

I found the kleenex, and it came in a 9-pack instead of the IRL 4-pack. Then I picked up a a set of basic Crayola markers, and the Target/school was enormously busy in the nearby checkout area, it looked like it was back to school shopping time, and yet there didn't seem to  be any kids there. In the check out l learned that most of the men there were buying things for their kids on their lunch break from a factory (to my knowledge, there aren't any factories in the suburb where I grew up, but I have read articles about meat processing plants elsewhere in MN having cases of COVID-19) so I tried to move through the crowd towards the back of the line behind them. In so doing, I saw someone I dated briefly in high school and haven't seen in the 10+ years since (yesterday IRL he was in an old photo posted by a mutual Facebook friend we went to high school). Past the largest bustle of people, I saw Hannah (who I went to middle and high school with, but also haven't seen in 10+ years), who was teaching at the school (IRL she's a teacher's aide, but I don't think she teaches in the district where we grew up any more). She and I spoke a bit, she asked why I had the markers, and I confirmed that I was getting them for my own use, not because I had a child attending school. She seemed somewhat surprised, but let it go. She took me to a part of the school that looked more like a nursery for toddlers than a classroom for elementary school or older children. There was a very wide room with large windows all along the hallway wall, and there were grandparents in the hallway by the open windows (the panes of glass vanished, the windows weren't opened). The little kids both seemed to be and weren't present in the nursery. There were posters that suggested that the school was either affirmatively trying to make the kids aware of notable female historical figures and/or it was women's history month, because all the posters were of women. Hannah and I turned around and the grandparents and nursery were gone. I was packing up my suitcase and backpack.  Then we were in the staff kitchen/lounge and it seemed that everyone else in the building was gone, and that school was out for the summer (IRL the MN governor announced a few weeks ago that schools will remain closed / have remote/virtual learning for the remainder of the school year). Hannah and I were fixing ourselves a dinner of things left behind in the fridge, looked like leftover cheese pizza and a carton of iceberg salad would be our dinner. Someone else (a man I didn't recognize) who clearly worked there and knew Hannah walked in to join us. I felt self-conscious because, as staff, he had far greater rights to any leftovers than I, a mere friend of a staff member, had. That said, he didn't object, we just got him a plate so he could microwave some pizza for himself too.",,

5288L,"I was at Hannah Shaw, the Kitten Lady's, house cooking. We were making lunch and I was making a pound cake. Kitty Lady came in while I was in the kitchen and I felt nervous and awkward around her. She said something about keeping the mess moving, so when she left I started drying the dishes. The cake recipe said to bake at some temperature for 10 minutes, and then at 465 degrees for 1 minute to get the bottom crispy. I kept toggling the temperature on the oven, but the number kept flying past 465. Sometimes I would be able to get pretty close, but then a commercial would start playing between each degree. I went back to the ice skating rink and there were lots of people there. Kitten Lady asked me if the cake was done. I said it needs one more minute. She opened the oven and these teenage boys were hanging around it and kept putting food in and taking it out and eating it. She had trouble putting the cake in. I said it's okay, I'll do it later. Then we all went out to the water, which was a river that was moving quickly. Andrew (Hannah's boyfriend) was on a boat and he said that he and Hannah had never hurt each other. I got on a little water craft and we all sped down the water. It was so much fun, but everyone was a little further up than me and I wished I was with my friends (I'm sensing some sort of Freudian theme here in my dreams...). I went back inside and Andrew and some other women were taking joke photographs. Then I went down some steep concrete steps to an event. The steps were painted colors but the paint was old and peeling. At the bottom of the stairs was a Chinese man, an usher, at the entrance to a venue. I sat down on the steps and then I said I forgot something. I ran back up the stairs and went back to the oven. I couldn't get the temperature again and it was going to take a while to preheat the oven once I got the right temperature, and the cake was cold by now, so I decided it wasn't worth the extra minute the cake recipe called for. I went outside and found Charlotte and Tess. They talked about having full-time jobs. Charlotte turned into someone else, another black woman. She said I count the months that I have a salary, and Tess showed her the keychain she used to keep track of the same thing. Tess lent her a costume of a train which was about Black history. I went across the street and Katie A.G. was there. I went into the ice cream store and KAG was there working. I realized she had been on a break outside. All the flavors on display were vegan and I wondered if it was Katie's idea. I walked up the line looking at the flavors. I went back to the front of the line. It was crowded in the store. A mom ordered strawberry ice cream, and I realized that the dairy flavors were just not on display. I saw a list of flavors written on a small white board in blue marker that was running out of ink. I saw apple ice cream and grapefruit sorbet. I told a woman with curly hair and glasses that I wanted a small cup. Steve was with me now. As I started walking over to the flavor I wanted, he repeated ""she wants a small."" I walked past the line to the flavor I wanted and pointed to it. Now the person serving me was a young woman with short straight blond hair. She asked me, ""did you pay already?"" and I said no. ""You're supposed to pay down there."" I asked why didn't they tell me down there? She told me how much it cost and asked if I had cash. I felt a $10 bill in my pocket but didn't say anything. I thought that we were only supposed to use cards now, and was confused about why she was asking for cash. There were so many people there and I realized how horrible it was that it was so crowded. She gave me the ice cream, plus another paper cup with change for a $10 in it. The loonie and toonie were huge. As I walked to the front I realized that there was only a tiny bit of ice cream in the cup, about two bites worth. I looked at Steve and he said keep walking. We walked out without paying the $10 I owed. I figured I wouldn't go back, and they don't know me. I finished the ice cream. ",,

I had asked Colin if he was available but he never responded and I asked Mike and he was, so I thought that was okay. I talked to Chanel about it. Later (or maybe separate dream), I was in my house getting up for the day and there was a long line of children walking through the house, led by a couple of camp counselors. I recognized them as Devon and Irene, two of my camp counselors from summer camp. I thought of saying hello but didn't really want to because I still had to wash my face and didn't look too presentable.

One of the staff members took my survey and read it. She then became extremely aggressive towards me and started coming at me yelling at me. I said ok I want to talk to the manager and she told me patient's can't talk to the manager. I pretended to leave but went down the hall where I know the manager's office is.  I went in and I told her about her colleagues and how they were not following public health guidelines.

I worked as a special ed. assistant for almost 17 years before they cut hours back and lost my full time (health benefits).  I then got my job as an evening custodian that gives our family health care.  Back to the dream though...I was working again as an assistant but also doing my current job.  When the busses came at the end of the day to pick up the kids, the little girl was missing.  The principal asked me to go check and see where she was.  I found her and she was so bundled up.  She had many coats, hats, scarves etc...  She can get angry easily so I held back saying that she was overdressed for the bus and let her go as is.  She finally got on the bus and there was a huge line of busses waiting to pick up other kids.  Then I was at a strange house that was also a store with different stalls selling things.  I spent a lot of time looking in a clothing stall for an orange shirt.  I couldn't find a style I liked so I left. Then I went into another room and my mom and step dad ( who has passed away) were on a couch talking with other people and I walked through the room.

She said ""But dog fights aren't positive"" and I said ""Yeah, but it's  a fun song, so maybe they'll go for it.""

Then we had to go to the hospital, where we swam into the pool to a door that brought us to an open area where gymnasts were sliding around.

21513L,I was at my grandparents house.  They have been dead for around 30 years.  They lived in the same town as us.  I was happy to see them but at the same time worried because they were living alone and were feeble.  They had a little dog and it was bleeding from its stomach.  I made a vet appointment for the dog for the next morning.  When someone else came to the house they looked closer on the dog and one of it's play toys had imbedded in the dog's stomach so they pulled it out.   I also had a dream that I was making peanut butter sandwiches for hiking.  Some of our family was visiting and we were going to go up to the mountains.  They were all waiting in the cars while I was trying to quickly make sandwiches.  The bread kept ripping and it was taking forever.  They finally got tired of waiting and came back inside.,,

1999S,"I was at my high school (not my real high school), but I was an adult, and was watching my friend/ex-boyfriend give a speech to an auditorium full of people, perhaps similar to but not actually a commencement address (in real life he was the student-voted speaker 2-3 times in his 5 years teaching at what was once our own high school before he moved to Vietnam this summer; I was part of a three-continent Zoom meeting he organized with friends on Saturday), and I ended up leaving early. I think I missed him a bit (in real life he's been dating another American teacher in Vietnam since late fall 2019). Inside the school there was a small indoor water park with water slides etc. so we (I think people from my work, but I don't know whom I was with, specifically) changed into swim suits, and found a locker to ball our clothes up into so we could go down the water slide. Not sure if I went down the slide (though I do recall being in line for it), but I left alone, perhaps to retrieve my clothes, but was walking down the long basement area that has large arch demi-domed sections to the left (like I've seen traveling abroad as well as on a walking ghost tour of Savannah, GA just over two years ago). I heard noises in one of the areas to the left, and got closer, and saw some clothed teenagers on the ground. At first I thought they were messing around and trying to be discreet, and perhaps some of them were, but others stayed lying on the ground, and I knew they were sick. I got closer, and saw a mound of sick/?some dead teenagers as the mound got closer to the back wallm. I checked the hand of on of the closest ones, and there was a slip of paper that said Corona in it. I was really frustrated, because I guess in the dream touching someone with COVID-19 meant you automatically got it too (notably, none of the sick teenagers seemed to be displaying any of the traditional symptoms, and certainly social distancing was not applying to the dream). I got in line to get tested, but all that meant was that I waited in line to pick up my own slip of paper that said Corona (not the real testing protocol, which three of my friends have had and described; they were all negative). I remember knowing I'd need to report that I'd tested positive on this survey this morning.  The scene changed and I was talking with my dad, who I think was finally going to join Facebook, but I was frustrated with him about something, and in response he pulled up a bunch of Facebook pictures that he said I'd sneakily included him in (in real life none of the pictures were real, and I seldom post pictures of him).

Then someone from a room to the side came to close the door.  Another dream (or part of this lass one) was me someone gluing some falling branches from a big tree and I was helping making them stick.

Then I run into an old administrator friend who recognized me and was happy to see me, she explained that she still sees the doctor I recommended to her 15 yrs ago.

Our pianist friend was trying to put the frame back together, which is not at all a good sign! Then unfamiliar cars started driving in, starting from the back garden, over the rose bushes and the patio with no regard for the destruction they were causing. Soon several lanes of cars had pulled into the long driveway too, so we were boxed in. My mother and I were taking photos of the license plates and trying to get the police to come, but they said they couldn't help us. Then it became clear that the cars were a distraction, as people had ransacked the dining room cabinets and taken the crystal and silver.    In another dream I was far away in a country house with my husband, and we were rearranging the furniture to accommodate more family. It was sort of rustic and traditional, surrounded by big yellowed pastures, a picket fence and New England forest.

It wasn't out for long and when it came back on I thought I'd do just one route before I left. I walked around and saw Lauren but didn't say hi because I didn't want to stay too long and only had a few minutes to climb. I walked up to a route marked V1 but it looked like the start hold was high up. There were holds from other routes on the way up that I tried using, but they were hard to hold onto despite looking like jugs. When I put my feet up I realized I was still wearing socks and not my climbing shoes. I gave up.     Steve called me asking if I had a flashlight. When I asked what he needed it for he said he had to look between his mattress and boxspring because he had bedbugs. I was horrified and sad because that meant that I couldn't come over anymore. ",,

I went and was fine and then my friend went and he's the one who lives on the lake so I wasn't too worried about him but I was supposed to be watching. And he comes up but he's struggling to put the weight jacket on the dock so he's holding it above his head trying to put it up there while his head is under and eventually he goes under from drowning so I jump in and I'm searching in murky water with my eyes open trying to do duck dives. Then the water clears and I see him and I grab him and pull him to the surface and I was so worried but he was fine once he got to the surface but I just kept hugging him and it was so nice. Then the dream changes to be at a church camp-like thing where you basically sell your soul to be in this cult and my friend is there and they have me cook and eat alligator. Then I have to ration out money and food going down a long line at a table, the same idea from The Platform on Netflix except I'm basically the platform.

We had been a bit lost, but we asked a some preschoolers if they knew the way back up and they were able to help us find the easy way back. Unfortunately, when I reported to work (all in this same enormous building/spaceship? - we had gravity) I was advised that we would have to move our work location from the office to this different basement area, we had to carry our workstation hardware down a narrow staircase/cave, and it was a bit scary to do so with your arms full of computer monitors that you couldn't drop. In the basement/cave new office area (it felt like we were being punished to be moved there, for talking to the preschoolers in the basement before) I had to fix my two monitors onto two narrow rods embedded in the wall (which looked like exposed pipes when you've stripped a wall of drywall and insulation during renovation). My brother (who in real life has also been working remotely from his apartment due to COVID-19 and with whom I've limited what I tell about work because he gets very arrogant/rude - ex. doesn't drop a topic even after I've explicitly asked him to three times in a conversation, until I've had to end the call / stop responding to his messages), was briefly there, offering tips about how to secure the monitors.",,

I heard many other students discussing how they had fallen on previous attempts. I was going to be late for class because I didn't want to fall off of the obstacle course so I was taking my time. Two other students - just as I reached the 4th lower level (which I was a bit confused about - couldn't remember if I had gone down 3 or 4 levels), two students near me grinned and said they were going to blow the school up, which worried me because the school system was the problem, not the individuals.",,

I lined him one of my used ones. I later wondered if I had any weird things in it. As we sat in lecture area I moved away from him. A group of homeless showed up and sat in hall. Later there was going to be a presentation by a microbrewery. They had cans of fancy beer on display. One of the young men from Brewery gave me a look.

2352S,"I was aware that social distancing was a current thing, but it wasn't being done where I was. It was Christmas time and I went to Jean, the church youth pastor's house for a holiday party (fairly certain she rents, in real life, though I've never been to her home; for four years I volunteered with her with the 7th-8th grade youth group, but I last did that five years ago, am mostly a Christmas and Easter church attendee, and faith doesn't play a regular part in my life; that said, I've been going to this church since I was three). The other party attendees were familiar but no one I recognized. There was a couple in their late 60s-70s that were talking about how social distancing didn't matter, which annoyed me (even though we were at a non-essential, medium-sized gathering where no one, including myself, was maintaining a 6ft distance from others). There was a small, wooden pull dragon toy (on a similar scale to a small wooden train set with magnets on either end of the middle pieces so you could customize it's length) that I think I'd been given the year before at the same party, though for some reason I was passing it on to someone else. While I was voluntarily giving it away, it felt in some respects like it wasn't something I wanted to do, but knew I had to. I went to a small side room by myself where there was a decorated Christmas tree and a lit fire and I played with the dragon toy one last time (note: I've never had a dragon toy). In the summer glow of the firelight and Christmas lights, I could see that I'd previously written a message on each piece of the toy before giving it to / sharing it with my family the year before, though in regular light you couldn't see the words. Jean walked in and said something about how she could see the toy meant a lot to me, and I could keep it. I said it was fine passing it on, but part of me didn't want to seem weak by accepting her kind gesture, and also then didn't want not to have contributed a gift.  The scene changed, I was both with and not with my best friend Sam - perhaps I'd called her? though I was also getting flashbacks to having driven with her in a car and taken silly pictures of each other with the car parked somewhere because we'd neglected to get pictures earlier (she lives in Chicago, I live in Minneapolis, and we only see each other 2-4 times per year). I had been talking with someone (perhaps an older couple at the party, though it wasn't Christmas time anymore) about how so many restaurants were closing, especially non-classic American food style ones (in real life one of my favorite pan-Asian restaurants permanently closed a bit over a week ago; I saw my last food charge from getting takeout from them in February on my credit card statement the day before yesterday), so you should always call first to make sure they're open before driving somewhere for takeout to support the local businesses (I've been doing this about once a week since the social distancing and stay at home orders went into effect). I was driving somewhere without, I think, having first ordered. I pulled up Google Maps, and the restaurant was much farther away than I'd expected, over 35 minutes away (further away than I'd generally get take out, since the food would be cold by the time you get home), I had to drive alongside a long lake for a while (similar to but not the same as when I drive to Sam's parents house in Minnetonka). At some point I got out of the car and was trying to walk there through a busy park at sunset-dusk (it had been much lighter out when I'd started driving). There were lots of large fountains, including multiple decorative sculptures that look like one in a park about a 10-15 minute walk from my apartment. I passed a group of four dressed up people on my right side as I walked (I think at least three of the four were performers who posed with tourists to get their photos taken, as I think one was talking about how she couldn't wait for work to be over).

It wasn't until after I found Annie and Angelina (a friend of a friend that I've only seen at our mutual friend's bachelorette and wedding weekends) at the speaker that I realized that Is left my keys at home, and that I'd need to call a locksmith to get me back into my apartment, but that strangely didn't bother me, and I focused on the speaker. Somehow Annie had recorded the presentation as a video on her phone (streaming this video on my phone, as well as Annie and Angelina waving as I got closer, was how I found them. But afterwards I learned that the stream was still live and Annie was getting firm / kind of mean messages from either the speaker or just some random internet troll that having the stream up was copyright infringement and Annie could be sued (Angelina, a real-life corporate lawyer, was no longer there to help).  The scene changed, I was getting ready for a camping trip with my friends Kelly (who I saw last night on a group video call) and Jo. We were maybe going to be in Canada but also Minnesota, so we needed to get permits to go. I went to my parents' house to pick up some paperwork for my permit application, and saw my brother (who lives in Germany) on a lounge chair outside watching Annie's video of the speaker; apparently it had become public, though I don't think Annie intended it to become so.

7241L,"I was both my current age as well as back in college. I was living in a large one-story house with three other roommates (IRL I've lived alone for the past almost 5 years, and haven't had more than one roommate since college) that was and wasn't in Madison, WI (where I attended undergrad). I'd been living there about a year in a huge room with two other women, but I was moving into the only single room in the house, across the hall, which was adjoined to the laundry/kitchen area. At first I was so excited the move, one of my roommates (possibly named Ashley or Lindsey?) had left me a few notes on hot pink post-its, but then I saw a note that said that her two cats would also be living in my big single room, and I was fairly certain that she knew that I'm allergic to cats. I noticed a few green cleaning products in the laundry area, and knew they were Ashley/Lindsey's, and recognized the green cleaning brand as one I'd used (not one I've used IRL), so I used my laptop (I didn't have a smartphone in college) and looked up an online message platform (whose website was in various darker shades of pink) and saw that Ashely/Lindsey had posted things as well as requested to add me as a friend/link. When I approved the request, I saw more of her profile, including a brochure about living in our house - there were pictures of her + our other two roommates + the other women who had previously been the fourth roommate (including on the cover, which made me feel sad), the only picture of me was on a page further back in the brochure, and it looked like she'd found and cropped it from another source. I didn't understand why I wasn't more included, but I was glad that Ashley/Lindsey had taken the trouble to track down a picture of me to be included. I went back to the main bedroom and grabbed my makeup kit, and missed being in that room vs. the single room with the cats. Ashely/Lindsey and one of the other roommates came in from the sunny outdoors, and asked me what I was up to - I had to go to work, but dearly wanted to play hooky and spend the day making a large breakfast and being outside with my roommates, but knew I needed to keep my commitment. I told the not-Ashley/Lindsey roommate about my cat allergies and how of course that meant that they couldn't stay in my room and she completely understood; when I told Ashely/Lindsey, she seemed resentful that I wouldn't be taking care of her cats and having them live in my room. A few attractive guys came over who knew those two roommates, but as much as I wanted to, I knew I couldn't stay to get to know them better. The scene changed, and some of my family came to visit me, and my brother and I were comparing menus about where to take the horse-drawn carriage to dinner, and whether I would be joining my immediate family at their hotel, given the cat situation at my house, but I was going to stay at my place. I saw my uncles and hugged them goodbye. It was dark when I got back to my house, and in the hallway I saw a ghost of an older middle-aged woman who told me that she could see me, and her son was gone. Somehow I knew Ashley/Lindsey was responsible for the ghost menacing me, and that Ashley/Lindsey had slept with and/or killed the ghost woman's son, and that Ashley/Lindsey was a witch. I saw a wand on a shelf, and somehow knew that someone had been looking for me - the scene changed and it was very dark outside and I was a young child standing in shallow, but not overly cold, rocky water. I think I had been a witch stolen from Hogwarts, though I was perhaps a toddler, too young to attend Hogwarts (whose minimum age of admission is 11 years old).

On the final section I was working on the design was more advanced, I was painstakingly adding much more of the black stick on decorations and drawing around them in chalk.

I think there was snow on the ground (it hasn't snowed in about two weeks where I live in Minneapolis).  The scene changed, I was a young teenager living in an apartment or dorm or boarding house with my sister (the bathrooms weren't in our unit, they were down the hall; I don't have a sister IRL) and I think we had been raised by a single dad who wasn't there (either he'd gone on a trip or recently died?).

I wanted to shave my legs and either didn't have or couldn't find my own or my sister's razor (maybe it was my first time shaving?), but I found a small hatchet, and I planned to try to be really careful and use that instead. I put on a long, fluffy pink bathrobe (not something I'd pick for myself IRL) and resolved to carry the hatchet inside the bathrobe so no one saw me carrying it around and would either get scared or try to stop me. I was concerned that I'd be cutting thin ribbons of my skin off by trying to shave with the hatchet (though when I worried about this, I wasn't bleeding, I pictured it more like the bloodless portioning of meat purchased by the pound at the deli), but I also knew that I had to and didn't ask my sister for help.",,

I wondered if I was infected but not symptomatic. As Hayley was in her room, I asked if I could bring her anything. She asked for some kind of food and I brought it up to her. I stepped into her room, which felt steamy, and I imagined inhaling the virus. I stepped out and regretted entering her room. Later, a group of us were walking down a residential street and we stopped at an elderly man's house (maybe for directions?). One of us in the group, who I think may have been another roommate, wanted to spend time with the old man. I thought this was a horrible idea, since we could easily make him sick, and I felt very nervous. I was in his kitchen and had something -- maybe compost? -- and I asked him where it went. He explained that outside his house, there was a tiny door at the bottom left of a structure, and that it went in there. I stepped  outside and found the hull of a boat. At the bottom left there seemed to be some sort of crevice. I hung my legs over the side to get to it, and realized looking down that I could fall to my death, as I was very high up. I hoisted myself back and realized that ""bottom left"" may have meant as you were looking at the house, not from it. I saw something down to my right that may have been what he was referring to.",,

He said it was a nice break to talk to an adult for a bit (presumably alluding to my grandma's dementia). I told him I'd make sure they played some Debussy (his favourite) as he passed.

There was a hazy dream about being unprepared for a performance of some kind, but it was the other singers too.

12889S,"I was holding a sheaf of paper, reading comments by one of my former thesis advisors on a independent study course that I had designed for myself, on the topic of China in the late Qing era. I thought about how China had enjoyed a couple military victories against the British, and the British had endured a couple unexpected losses, and how this precedent had disastrously emboldened China in ways that led to their humiliating defeat in the Opium Wars and the consequent decline of their once-mighty empire.    [Dream logic: Pretty sure this is *not* a historically accurate analysis, as I don't think China's assumption of global superiority had been militarily tested prior to the Opium Wars... but I haven't actually studied this era in detail.]     ""Hubris,"" I muttered, identifying the real agent of China's nineteenth-century decline. And today the same dynamic was in the process of undermining the United States. For all that hubris has animated the last half-century of American life, it is now blatantly embodied in a figure almost allegorical in its consistency of expression.     ""HUBRIS!"" I found myself shouting, feeling very frustrated with my country right now, my voice ringing loudly against the walls. I smiled apologetically to a young woman who was passing by. It occurred to me that I was passing through the halls of the old Qing imperial palace, a poetic parallel with my thoughts.     [Dream logic: The building I identified as the Qing imperial palace actually looked like the second-floor lobby and wide, wood-paneled halls of a modern five-star hotel.]     Hubris, Ate, Nemesis: the ancient dramatic formula was precise and ineluctable. So how much Hubris and Ate could Forty-Five get away with before Nemesis came on stage? Perhaps we're living through that act now. But did he have to take down the whole country with him?     I got to the last room only to realize that I wasn't sure why I had come this way, all my business was in the other direction, so I hurried back.

Then as we were driving we heard a train crossing bell. I think we were trying to get wherever we were going by a certain time, but we said ""let's wait, we have time."" The driver, who was the woman, turned and began driving along the train tracks between two fields of corn. I thought this was dangerous, and there was not much room to pull over if another train happened to drive by.

10986L,"I was in a city that existed in two parallel worlds that were physically identical, and superimposed. I could pass between the two using portals.     In some barren rubble underneath a slightly raised building, I saw two square ceramic tiles that had been propped up with stones. I knew that tiles like these could be occasionally found in the city, and I was tempted to keep any I found, but reflected that it was better to set them up for public use, like these. The two tiles I was looking at had stylized line drawings that I recognized as images of the Virgin Mary. Although I did not share the faith they represented, I knew that I could use them as portals. After passing through, the environment was the same except that now the image on the two tiles was a red mass resembling fish roe.     Straight ahead in the distance I saw a tall narrow building with a wider circular top surmounted by a narrow spire that I recognized as my destination, so I started walking toward it. As I walked, I tried to plan the rest of my day: should I make a reservation at 5pm for my husband and I to eat dinner? But we had a train trip planned for the evening that would take a couple hours. If we waited, we would be eating late but our destination had better restaurants.     Then I starting wondering what the real difference is between the two superimposed cities. Is the difference that in this one, animals can talk? I pass by several cows and put this to the test. ""Hello cows!"" I say, but they do not answer. Yet this version of the city seems more fairy-tale like, somehow, more whimsical, than the one I am from.     My thoughts were interrupted when I came across a bank robbery in progress. It manifested like a video being played on fast forward, with those characteristic streaks, but the voiceover was playing at a normal speed. There was a middle-aged detective investigating a quadruple homicide, which had apparently targeted the four richest customers. The video was playing footage of the bodies: they resembled plucked chickens. [Day residue: dismembered and grilled a chicken for dinner last night.] The detective speculates aloud that the worms did it.     As I walk, I am pulling a small wagon behind me, which I will need at my destination. When I finally reach it, another scene ensues that resembles a battle scene in a JRPG. I exchange the contents of the wagon and return to the place from which I started, passing throug the portals again.     Later:   Dozing in late in the morning, I experience dream awareness that falls well short of lucidity. I realize I am dreaming and decide to do a test: I will levitate some boxes, and see if I can maintain them in that state as I transition into wakefulness. I ""wake up"" (in the same place) and the boxes fall down. Nevertheless I am heartened, because I observe that in the dream I at least succeeded in moving the boxes from where they had been placed originally in the room. [Dream logic: Not only was it a false awakening, but the environment I was in was a big cluttered room reminiscent of a science lab that resembled nothing from waking life, an observation that I (as usual) failed to make.]   ",,

I was shocked because I'm fairly certain it's not illegal to be disengaged with the lecture, and concerned over the consequences of calling the police on POC for trivial things. There was another component of the dream that had something to do with being in a group of people who travelled around the world and flew all the time. ",,

I left and ran into a friend, we walked into a restaurant to meet people but I said I was scared to stop in the restaurant because of the coronavirus. It was really crowded. So we walked through really fast and went outside. We started to cross the street and a car drove up really fast, screeched and stopped right in front of us. My friend yelled at the driver and stepped on the hood of his car which squished it a little. Later I was at home and I opened Facebook to find that a friend of mine had compiled clips from every video I had ever posted into one video, and that it had gone viral.

I went to a bathroom, past a bunch of people. The room looked like the library basement at my university. I think I may have had a nosebleed.     I woke up on a plane and it was the first of two flights to Japan. My legs were cold and uncomfortable. I worried that the next flight would be uncomfortable and I would panic on it with no exit for many hours. My mom was sitting next to me and I started telling her how I felt. I said maybe I should have taken one of my cousin's Ativan (I think from an earlier part of the dream that I don't remember). The man in the seat in front of me turned around and started talking to us. It seemed like he was being friendly and trying to calm me down. He was a Japanese man with a down jacket like the kind I have. Then he turned into the actor who plays Owen Hunt and he was asking my mom about her life. I couldn't remember the actor's name in my dream. My mom said the last time she made this trip was when we left Japan years ago when me and my brother were small. She said she went up to us on the plane (we were sitting by ourselves several rows up) but something happened (I forget now) and she couldn't get to us and we thought it was funny even though it was upsetting or embarrassing. He asked how old she was now and how old she was then. She said it was after her marriage and after her divorce and she had to make her own way in the world. Then we found our seats for the next flight and mine was just a few rows ahead. Owen's seat was back several rows and I thought I could go see him if I wanted. But the aisle around my seat was so small I didn't know if I could get through. Then my mom and I were in a car and my mom was driving and I cleaned the windshield from the inside. It was dirty. ",,

28417S,"I was in a long narrow hotel room, I was sitting in a chair facing a television and the door opened and then I saw there was another door opening at the end of the room and I thought how could there be two doors in the hotel room for the same room and someone was coming in each door and I thought who is the expected person and how do I know which one is the real one?",,
6247S,I was in a mall during the stay at home and people wouldn't stay six feet away from me and it was stressful. ,,
6756L,"I was in a mall in my hometown, and part of the upstairs of the mall had been converted into an exercise room with mats on the floor-but no gym equipment-so I was stuck doing bodyweight exercises (like I am at home in my waking life during the pandemic, since my gym is closed). There were other women exercising there that I didn't recognize, and I ended up introducing myself to them. After a bit of conversation that I don't recall, we agreed  to meet up later on to have lunch and do some shopping downstairs in the mall. One of the women was named Julia and I seemed to click with her the most. What's interesting is that in my waking life before the pandemic, I would normally avoid making small talk with strangers at the gym as much as possible, and prefer to exercise alone, but in the dream I really seemed to be enjoying myself.

4820L,"I was in a mausoleum type of cell, stone walls, underground. There was an alcove where an old desiccated body rested in its coffin, somewhat elevated by a platform or ledge. Someone had removed the lid of the coffin, and apparently this had led to the expulsion of some of the contents, because on the wall to the left of the door-less entrance--(the entrance was on the right, putting you in front of the foot of the coffin, and the alcove stretched to the left, just far enough to accommodate the head of the coffin and room to walk alongside it, so I mean the wall to the left of the entrance that would be behind you if you were standing in front of the head of the coffin, looking in)-there was a large patch of texture and discoloration, a combination of thick, ultra-fine grey dust and something blacker and maybe moister, tendrilling perhaps. I knew this to be the remains of her flesh. Despite whatever accident had occurred, the body in the coffin was fairly intact, skeletal, identifiable as a woman by the remnants of her white bridal gown and veil. Whoever had removed the lid of her coffin had replaced it with a narrow mattress. Since the lid was gone, the mattress was resting directly over the open coffin and her body. I was trying to make a nice bed of it since I would have to sleep there, but I was feeling apologetic to the coffin's inhabitant, and I didn't want to disturb her any more than she had been already. I tried rearranging the mattress, and on the underside found a similar pattern of dust and discoloration to what was on the wall. But in the process I might have flipped it, so now there was a stain on both sides, and I was scrutinizing them trying to figure out which side was less stained so I could make sure that one faced up. I was concerned about the physical properties of the grave dust, because I had heard that it was so fine that it could clog up delicate machinery. I didn't feel any real fear of the corpse, more like what Thais would call krengjai, respect and a desire to be considerate. I was unintentionally an interloper here, and I felt bad that her body had already been disturbed, and wanted to do my best not to make things any worse.",,

When the meeting was over, he dropped the bag on the floor and I had to pick it up and throw it away. I was very bitter because I had to throw out the bag but I didn't even get to eat my chips.

There was debris and construction materials on the floor.  One room had old boards and I was crawling over a bunch of old boots on the floor.  I was looking at them and started to take one and realized they were single boots with no matches.  Then I looked over to the side and I saw an old tool leather tool belt and thought my husband might like it so I picked it up.  As I was leaving the room I heard a voice and construction vehicle below and realized it belonged to someone.  I dropped the belt and tried to hurry out because the two people below heard me and were coming up to investigate.  ,,

I went back to Sarah. Then everyone was in court lined up to speak to the judge and it was my turn, I was last in line, and I didn't know what to do. The judge said ""do you know your nine options,"" but I didn't know them. Someone took me aside and then I was on a plane getting seated. I decided to get up and move to the quiet area, but the quiet area was full of young people who all seemed to be friends. I sat down and looked out the window and realized I was right at the front of the plane, I could see the nose (no pilot on this plane) and that we were still on the ground and hadn't taken off yet. Later, I was in a house with Steve. We were walking around the rooms. It wasn't our house. I walked into a room with a big statue made of metal hands. I walked past a bookcase and saw the owner's portrait. He looked like an older version of Mikkel from Copenhagen so I thought it was his dad. But in my dream I couldn't remember his first or last name, so when I saw the owner's last name I still couldn't be sure that it was Mikkel's dad.

After the party, I was with my boyfriend in our own room and we slept there - we woke up at 5:30pm the next day. I was writing to one of my childhood friend that I woke up that late, then felt bad because we haven't talked for years. I went out in the field, it was actually my parents backyard, but amplified, much larger, as if it was the countryside instead of the suburbs. I went to see another one of the little house by a wood. My cousin was there, they were hanging things on the ceiling, installing professional lights to make a clip. I saw part of the clip, a girl running in the forest. The first part was animated (drawing) then it became real footage, I wondered how they made that. I looked back at our own 'house'/room where we slept with binoculars, my boyfriend was sitting on the balcony reading, and there was a cat sitting next to him. It was endearing.",,

There was a shower thing with a range of buttons you could push so you could take a shower in a kind of fantasy land. I pressed a button and ended up in a shower with a small guy, young, maybe Hispanic, with wavy hair longish on the top, holding the telephone-shower for me and then he started massaging and kissing me. It felt so good, I ignored the fact I didn't know him and that he had a flowery tattoo on one side of his neck. It got hot and heavy then I jumped out but I knew I could go back just by pushing the button. Would anyone suspect if I went back to the same shower even though there was a large choice of them? I was prancing through this gigantic house trying to appear nonchalant when I either decided to go back into the shower or just found myself there. This time it was getting close to actually having sex. I wondered if I needed protection. The feeling was overpoweringly physically seductive. Then I found myself back in this giant cavernous house with huge Peale-like drapes everywhere, partially pulled back and revealing surprising things. Then I saw my former husband and I thought to myself maybe I'd have sex with him just because it might feel good, even though I couldn't stand him.",,

Part of our plane got blown off as we tried to make an escape and then we ran partially into another plane but we got to the highway and we went down the highway in these planes in all this traffic. Our plane turned into a car and my mom was there but we were all worried this plane was going to follow us so we were trying to get down the highway to a restaurant or something where we could avoid the plane that was shooting.

On the back of a tub of hair conditioner we found the name of a chemical which had such disastrous effects on the human body that every government in the world had weaponized it when society collapsed, finding a way to centralize it in a high powered beam they could aim at small points. I can't remember what happened after that, only that we were on a tiny patch of islands in the middle of the sea that you could wade between and there were giant crabs the size of houses that were a result of the chemical warfare.

9328S,"I was in a Starbucks in a cyberpunk kind of New York City and it was late at night. There were plants everywhere and RGB lighting, but the baristas looked exactly the same and the drinks were pretty standard Starbucks. I sat in the back with a group of eclectic people at a tall table. There was a guy at our table holding a worn paperback book that looked like a romance and he was defending it like a proper hipster. I asked if it was a Bollywood Book, and he laughed and looked away like I was a total idiot not worth his time. A tall guy next to me asked him what the book was if it wasn't Bollywood, and the hipster guy gave him an explanation. I was pretty miffed that he hadn't answered my question, yet talked to the guy next to me, but I let it slide. I didn't even know the guy that well. I then wondered if I'd offended him somehow and felt sad, but I didn't talk to him to find out. The table talked about a lot of different subjects and it was a blast. Except for book guy, everyone was a good listener and had funny stories to tell. Eventually the Baristas started giving us dirty looks and we realized that it must be pretty late. I felt delirious and in our scramble to leave I grabbed two forks from a bussing tray. When we were outside we all started laughing about the forks. I put them in the shirt pocket of one of the guys next to me and patted it like I had just given him a million bucks. Half of our party had to go to a parking garage to pick up the cars they'd driven. It seemed unusual and they explained that they were going to a concert and had to drive. I tested out what it would be like to go to the concert with them and the next thing I knew I was in a long line of cars, in outer space, to wait to see some band I had never heard of. There were no bathrooms or snacks  and a parrot was in the backseat pecking and squawking ceaselessly. I left that dream and went back to when we were all outside the Starbucks and hastily said goodbye to the concert goers. The rest of us walked through a graveyard to reach the house we were staying in. It was a Victorian house, but very run down. There was a huge four poster bed on the lawn, and two of us decided to lay there for awhile and continue talking. Someone else tagged along. We climbed on the bed and centuries of dust puffed around us in a smog. Someone joked that Voldemort would show up in all the dust. He didn't. I started looking behind us and I saw a gigantic shiny black spider running toward us. I didn't know spiders could run, but this one was and it moved with the intent to kill us. You could just tell that the spider was out for blood and it was personal. We took a slide off the bed and started running for the house. One of the guys started joking and lagging behind, and I couldn't believe it. I shoved him inside the front doorway and slammed the door shut just as the spider crashed into the door. I could hear it scream. No one else seemed bothered, they thought it was gross, but they told me that they weren't worried. I was worried.

The woman who opened a window for me was not impressed by my tiny fish for sale, and said it would be a few hours before she could get ""the big boss"".

It was a huge room full of old books and small souvenirs on the shelves. A young couple that was staying with me in the same room urged me to take my things because we were about to take a flight back home. I was really anxious about how to take all my things with me, and seeing that it was impossible I started filling my bags with the small souvenirs while thinking about how I would order my books back to my home, and how much will it all costs. I got into the bathroom to get ready to go. Inside there I also have stored small souvenirs and had trouble changing my socks inside a really small shower cabin full of things. For some dream logic, it was clear to me that I would never be traveling again like I was before and I would never again have so much money as I supposedly had in my dream past. By the way, I have never been that rich in real life, rather I have not been rich at all, although not poor either. I don't remember much of the rest of the dream but we were on a tour to some other locations and I thought the group was annoying, the places lame and the toilets disgusting.",,

(The K-8 school I went to was an alternative learning school called the Logan School for Creative Learning and the older kids would go on big overnight/out of state field trips a couple of times a year, in my dream I was on one of these). I remember we were getting into a massive helicopter and the pilot was the guy who used to run the field trips in real life, Dan. I asked Dan if we were going to Keystone Science School and he said we didn't do that anymore. I remember saying TWICE how my favorite part of the trips was the wide variety of transportation experiences we got...there was a long road next to a frozen river.

Then my family was trying to pack up everything on the ship we needed to bring to the plane. I was having trouble fitting everything I had into my purse. But then the boat turned into a bus that my dad was expertly navigating through the hotel lobby.

The cup had sand at the bottom. Steve was walking ahead of me to the bus. I ran after him. We were both running, and we overtook the person who was first in line. We kept running down a hill and across a street until we got to a diner. Steve was someone else now. We went in. It was a very old-school diner and we sat in a booth where two elderly women were already sitting on one side. I sat down next to them. I said my clothes are going to smell like oil when we leave. After we were there for a couple of minutes, an elderly man came over and asked if I could scooch down. I said I'll let you in and got up to let him pass so that I could remain sitting across from my friend. I was sitting on the very edge of the vinyl seat now and uncomfortable because the seat had an indentation from over the years and I was sitting half over the indentation. The three elderly people were now looking at a newspaper and deciding to go see a Rosie O'Donnell movie.¬†    Next dream: Steve texted me that my next-door neighbor was from Boston. I wrote back asking how to get in touch with him, and then realized the first text had included the phone number. The phone number's area code was 607, which I gathered was a Western Massachusetts area code. Then I was in a car with Steve. We had just got back from a trip and he had parked in the next-door neighbor's driveway. We were eating cherry tomatoes from the box. In the car, I asked him how he knew that my neighbor was from Boston and how had gotten his number. He didn't want to tell me. He said it was once when he had a guitar lesson and the student didn't show up... But he didn't finish telling me. I looked up at the car we were blocking in the driveway, which was a reddish jeep, and at the side door of the house in front of which there was a silver folding lawn chair. I thought that the neighbor from Boston must be the new neighbors, because the old neighbors were not from Boston. I hadn't seen the new neighbors yet. Maybe I knew them. There was a rotting wet tomato in the box we were eating from. I got out of the car and went next door to my house. As I climbed the steps to the front door I realized I left my keys in the car. I looked in through the front door and saw Hayley's pajamaed leg on the couch. I knocked and she opened the door. She and Jac were in the living room. They told me that Ollie and Pascal (their cats) had found ""something"" and that they didn't know where it was.¬†I understood them to mean some kind of creature; first I thought it was dead but then I realized it was still alive.¬†",,

15222L,"I was in a virtual meeting and it was difficult for me  to connect due to technical difficulties. I ended up joining the meeting about 15-20 minutes late. When I did connect I found that my supervisor was showing a Star Trek episode, which was narrated by Lemony Snicket for some reason.     In the episode Captain Janeway was with an away team on some planet, which seemed very similar to Earth. They were in and around a parking garage. There was this alien that could take over peoples minds, and spread like a virus. The alien was also a shape shifter, and would take the shape of a small child and sort of hypnotize humans into not hurting it. When someone got taken over by the alien ""virus"" you could tell because their eyes would flash blue every once in a while. Also their personalities would be different. The alien would try to emulate the human behaviour, but didn't always do it that well. When someone was taken over by the virus there was nothing anyone could do, and it was understood that they were as good as dead since there was no cure for this. They had to kill anyone who was found to be taken over by the alien to prevent it from spreading.    Towards the end of the away mission, Captain Janeway realized that everyone on the away team except for her had been taken over by the alien, as she saw their eyes flashing and they were acting strange. Then she ordered an emergency beam up to the Starship Enterprise, which is inaccurate because Janeway was the captain of the starship Voyager, not Enterprise, but this was a dream. Anyway, Janeway got beamed up to the Enterprise just in time, as her infected crew were trying to attack her once they knew that she knew that they were being controlled by the alien.    When she got there she found that the crew in the transport room were suspicious that she had been taken over by the alien, as she was also suspicious that they had been taken over by the alien. There was some initial tension and mutual suspicion. In the transportation room there were several crew members who had gone on a previous away mission, but I missed that part of the episode because I was late to the meeting. They were all quarantining in the transport room to try and keep the alien from spreading to the rest of the ship. One of the crew members had been seriously injured. It looked like he had been struck by lightning but in just his leg. Apparently the injury was from the alien trying to take over his mind, but the guys brother, a fellow crew-member had shot the alien and saved him, but the alien killed the guys brother, and the injured guy was still mourning. The injured guy was apparently the only person to survive an attempt at being taken over by the alien.     Janeway joined the crew members, who were all close friends in sitting in a circle on the floor and discussing what had happened. Everyone looked into each other's eyes all the time to look for the telltale blue flashing in case anyone had been taken over by the alien, as they were not sure how this spread.     At one point Janeway sees the blue flashing in the eyes of all of the crew members except for the injured one. Without hesitation she pulls out a handgun (I don't know why she would be using a handgun and not a phaser, as people usually do in Star Trek) and shoots them all in the head, as there is nothing else she can do for them. She then points the gun at the injured guy and he closes his eyes, while crying a little and says ""just do it"". Then Janeway lowers her gun and realized that this guys' mind has not been taken over by the alien, since the alien would not be willing to die to save everyone else on the ship.    Then the narrator Lemony Snicket explains that this guy is a carrier of the alien ""virus"". This is because of his unique situation, where the alien started to take over him but was stopped. He is still in control of his mind, and has not been taken over, but he can still spread the alien to other people, and Janeway will have to figure out what to do with him.    Then the episode ends with a ""To be Continued"", and I wake up for my actual remote work meeting, which is far less exciting.",,

4918S,"I was in a zine library with Andrea. I was in the children's zine section, and they were all zines made by children. I read one. Someone gave me a dirty look like they were judging me for reading a whole zine without taking it out. I browsed the other sections and saw a multi-part section and wanted something like a trilogy. But then a performance was starting, and I took my seat in the audience. I lost Andrea. I was excited for it, but it was a musical and I hate musicals. The performance lasted a full day. Then at the end it was SNL. I might have been on stage as a volunteer, but somehow I ended up backstage, which was underground in a basement. The cast and crew were watching a livestream of the show on a small tv screen. There was no audio but they were mouthing the lines along with the broadcast. Then everyone hid under a table in the next room, which looked like a high school chemistry classroom with tall lab benches. I understood that they were surprising someone and had a feeling I wasn't supposed to be there, so I walked away.   Next dream, or maybe the same dream, after SNL: Pete Davidson and I were in a store that was like Target or Walmart. We split up and I went to look for something but I couldn't find it. I walked through the aisles. There was a cereal aisle and I noticed a cereal that was like life or cinnamon toast crunch but it was called something like ""magic"" in rainbow colors like lisa frank, and it was a low-sugar alternative for diabetics. Then there was a whole aisle full of sewing kits, and they were all sew your own --- underwater creature. There was a sew your own wallet one, but the wallet was like a fish, an aquatic creature. I understood that it was from a meme on the internet, and these were all projects for people stuck indoors. I got overwhelmed all of a sudden, and got my phone out to call Pete. Before I could dial he was right behind me, hugging me. ""Who are you calling?"" he asked. I said, ""Bartolok!"" and he said ""who's that?"" ""The composer whose pieces you've been playing for me!"" I said. (maybe it was a mash-up between Bartok and the name Bartolo?). And I told him I wanted to be with you because I was feeling overwhelmed. We walked together through the store, going through the beauty section, and I saw deodorant. ""Oh yeah,"" I said, ""I need deodorant."" But they didn't have my brand. Then I did see my brand, but all the liquid deodorant in it was black and it was vanilla scented. Then I noticed that the bottles didn't actually have any labels on them and I wondered if it was a prank. We left the store into Harvard Square and it was so crowded. We crossed the street by the news stand towards Starbucks and I stopped him and kissed him for a long time. He morphed into my boyfriend Steve. We kept walking. There were huge crowds. We passed a church with a fenced courtyard and there were all these Indian women wearing matching saris bent over in prayer. A parade of people in costume passed us to our left, and they were all in monochromatic outfits and ordered in a rainbow. I thought that if they got sick, they'd know where they were in the procession and who they might have caught it from or infected. There were more huge huge crowds. We crossed the street and narrowly missed a car. We needed to get to the subway. There was just one bus we needed to catch that would take us home (to Waterloo?), from the red line station. I knew I had touched surfaces that might have been contaminated and thought that I needed to keep my hands away from my face. ",,

138LA,"I was in Beverly Hills with my sister and a bunch of other ladies and we were walking down the street and a big dog with a kind of a brindle coat came running and he was unleashed and was with nobody and I was alarmed that he was lost so I caught him by the collar and that started a long process of trying to use the phone to call the police, to call the owner, to call anybody to tell them about the dog, and we went inside this restaurant that was open and we just had the dog on the floor by a table and I started using my cell phone to call the police and I kept pushing the wrong button everything would show up in Russian or Chinese because I kept pushing the wrong button by mistake and I couldn't get the call through and meanwhile all the other ladies were just talking and chatting and then I tried to ask the store owner if he could hold the dog there and call the police or something and the store owners were busy and I couldn't speak to anybody so then I had the bright idea to look on the dog's collar and see if his owner's information was there on one of the tags and there was an owner's phone number and he lived in Chelsea MA (the dog's tag said ""Chelsea Record""- that is a newspaper in Chelsea, maybe the owner worked there) and I said oh he lives in Chelsea and I didn't stop to think that we were 3000 miles from there but anyway then I started to try to call that number and I couldn't do it,  the phone wouldn't function properly, I couldn't put the numbers in and I just went on like that for a while then I was trying to get the attention of the restaurant person, an older man, to ask him if he could keep the dog and make the call so we could leave, and then I was using Nancy's (my sister) phone and and it wouldn't work either and then Nancy started getting short with me and saying ""you can't do that, don't do that, don't just call out the phone number aloud"" because I read the phone number aloud and then she said ""does he speak Chinese?"" meaning the owner and I thought it was a stupid absurd question: why is she asking that? and I said ""well Nancy I don't know if he speaks Chinese maybe he does"" and then when I looked at the tag again the owner's name was a Chinese name which was kind of odd, LIN was the last name and I thought well maybe Nancy's question made sense but then when I looked at the tag again the owner's name was Charles Mason and I thought what happened to the Chinese name and things went on like that for a while, and the dog was rather friendly throughout, he looked like he could be a vicious dog but he wasn't.

1300S,"I was in CA with my best friend Sam at a berry-picking farm / co-op / hair salon / doctor's office (I read a BBC article this week about how they were seeking volunteer to pick berries in England because they weren't able to get workers from other countries to come into the country to pick the fruit; Sam is a critical care nurse). The farm portion didn't look like any berry farm I've been to in real life - the ground seemed drier, the foliage you'd expect on the raspberry plants want really there. But then a guide (dressed in khaki like a safari guide - I watched Tiger King last weekend) showed me this enormous raspberry (almost the size of an adult human head) hidden under some fuzzy white stuff (like a cross between cobwebs and cottonwood tree 'snow') - I cleared away the white stuff, I think so was allowed to pick it? but I don't think I picked anything else. Inside was not a berry farm check out area, but an almost entirely empty, large co-op where seemingly there was just Sam, her dad waiting outside, me, and two staff. I don't remember what I had been looking for, or if I ultimately found it - maybe I was lost? - but when I saw Sam at checkout, she had a bunch of Madewell clothes she'd found on clearance (piles of then filled the long check out conveyor belt; in real life she prefers to buy clothes from thrift shops and secondhand stores, both to save money as well as because she likes the adventure of not knowing what she'll find; I suspect the dream used the brand for its literal meaning). As the checkout clerk checked her purchases out, I saw Sam's eyes tear up as she realized the total was getting too high for her to afford. She asked the clerk to clarify that the items were as on same as she expected them to be, and they were but the price was still too high (100% sure this part of the dream was about the very legitimate fear that they'll run out of sufficient PPE for her and her colleagues at the hospital; they have at least one COVID-19 patient on their ward). Her dad must've been waiting in the car outside, and we tried to reach him because neither me nor Sam had our wallets and couldn't buy the clothes, but couldn't. The dream changed again when we went outside, Sam wasn't there, but I saw my friend Anna, and we were alongside a lake or river (not entirely unlike the different summer camps we both went to growing up), Anna's sister Amy (who I haven't seen since high school, but will likely see at Anna's wedding this fall) was there. I think the two of them had previously gone canoeing with the counselors that were sitting near the water with a sign up display board at a picnic table. The scene changed again and I was inside with Anna in almost a dorm-like place, something had happened and I think Anna had killed her boyfriend (not her real life fiance, the corpse didn't look familiar), and I helped her hide the (surprisingly light) body under her (why wasn't it lofted if we were in a dorm room?) bed. I think we were roommates (we went to different colleges). We had people over for a movie night (Anna and I, along with mutual friends have had remote Netflix Party viewings two weekends ago) in the room with the body under the bedz though the tiny TV (about the size of the old VHS travel TVs that could fit in between seats) was on the wall facing the opposite direction of the beds), and I think somehow a shriveled arm of the corpse had come out from under the bed, one of our guests saw it and asked (very calmly) about it, and Anna said there had been an accident, something about either magic (Anna and her fiance are both big Harry Potter fans; I am too to a much lesser degree) or a tiger, and this explanation was readily accepted. The scene changed again to a doctor's office-cum-hair salon; Anna was gone, Sam was back. I saw a doctor (possibly for my heart, I think I had an EKG but not a real EKG; in real life I don't have any cardiac symptoms or conditions) but something scared me and I ran all through the complex, through many connected exam rooms (I don't think anyone was chasing me, and no one seemed to think it odd that I was walking into other people's medical consultation or crouching and squeezing past people vs. walking through the adjacent, relatively obstacle-free hallway). I knew I needed to get to Sam. When I found her, I saw that she'd had her hair trimmed and dyed a color she's never dyed it before (mostly light blond with a darker brown under layer; she was a toe-headed blind as a child whose natural hair color as an adult is middle dark brown) and her hair was crimped (which she's never done in real life, to my knowledge). We didn't talk, I was startled that her hair made me barely recognize her, and I didn't like it, but I didn't say so. I think I grabbed a bunch of haircutting drapes from under a side table and ran.",,
12374S,"I was in camp or something similar. It was in the nature and I remember thinking it looks very much like the Danube Delta. It was very green and beautiful but it felt like I wasn't suppose to be there. I didn't knew any of the people and I felt like in 2nd grade when I was in a school camp to the sea side and it was beautiful but there were too many people and I felt like I didn't belong there.   I remember I was wearing a white summer dress, very comfortable and thinking that it is going to start raining and it will get cold.   Then I remember the water was green-ish and I could see crocodiles in the water. They were at the bottom of the water and I was in the water. I wasn't scared. I was thinking that there are so many creatures in the water and then the water turned opaque so I couldn't see at all what it was in the water with me. I knew the crocodiles are there and I also knew they will not harm me. And I was floating in that green opaque water thinking about what it is beneath it.   [I wonder why it wasn't strange for me too see crocodiles in the water. We don't have crocodiles here. I haven't seen one in my entire life - except on tv shows. ]  I remember the houses were made of wood and to get from one house to another you had to go through their porches. It was strange because I was meeting people I didn't knew.   That is all. I can remember very clearly the green branches of the trees going close to the river's water and the feeling of a strange, wild place mixed with respect and... not fear but rather acceptance of the unknown",,

We were planning on flying out that night but hadn't bought tickets yet. I suggested we go to Los Angeles before going back and Steve said that would be good. I tried finding Seb's email address, there were many. There was a stand on the sidewalk with someone selling their bad paintings on posterboard you can buy from the pharmacy. We took one and I started painting over it. Then I realized I didn't want to use the whole board because that would be expensive to ship. I cut out a small rectangle and wrote a message to Seb to mail. Then I realized the stupidity of what I had done -- we had to buy the painting now for $16 and I didn't even need it to write my message. I said it was the stupidest thing I had ever bought. The seller gave us another painting for free, which was better than the first one but still bad. Steve and I walked through a park with massive pinecones on the ground. On the edge of the park there was a pile of garlic that someone had tossed out, and all sorts of animals were rooting around in it. I thought for a second about taking a bulb but didn't want to disturb the animals, and then realized that it would be gross and probably rotting. We walked into the airport and I looked at the flights. The flights tonight were all booked so we would have to stay the night and fly out in the morning. I realized even if we wanted to fly out tonight we wouldn't have any time in Copenhagen before the flight. We passed by a bathroom and a woman with a head covering came out and said her son had had a bad allergic reaction. She seemed very upset. I tried asking her questions about her son, but then I realized that her son was not there and she was telling us something that had happened a long time ago. She walked us further down the hallway, opposite the direction we were going in, and there was a private bathroom that I understood was hers; she had lived there for many years. She pulled out a wooden shower head and showed it to me; this was what had hurt her son. But she was talking about it as if it were a vaccine and she was an anti-vaxxer. Like she was trying to sell us something or convince us of a conspiracy theory. A woman who had overhead said you're not supposed to sell it to us, meaning that the woman was actually making vaccines sound really good.

My dad warned me that I would need extra time to get to her house, and somehow instead of using technology to help me get to her house (I don't think I had a phone in the dream; my uncle had bought my Nana's house from his siblings after her death, but ultimately after having moved to France in 2009 and having issues repaying the mortgage, the house was sold to strangers late last year - my dad drove past the house in real life a couple weeks ago) I went to the church my Nana used to attend (it wasn't really her church) as though it would help me get there. I spent time in the church, spoke with the choir (I don't know anyone who currently attends the church), went up to a second or third story level via a narrow side staircase (that I don't believe exists in real life) and ended up I'm a room where there were lots of kids in a room about to watch a movie (maybe for Bible school?). I left that room and it only seemed to be then that I realized that I could find my Nana's house by using the cross streets (even at this point in the dream I couldn't remember how to get there, even though I've driven and been driven to her house as an adult), and I felt better about the fact that I'd be arriving late because I'd gotten lost and stopped at the church (where I don't recall asking anyone for directions). I might have made it to her house, but I'm not sure; if I did, it wasn't really her house. Next I recall being in a store with my mom where they sold keychains that said something like No, Never, Not One More (in English and Not-Spanish that was meant to be Spanish; I last took Spanish when K was 10 and don't speak it). The message was supposed to be about making sure no one else is raped / abused (I was watching Law & Order SVU before bed, and one of the episodes was about a group of Hispanic teenage girls who were raped - two by their father, one by her father figure). A young adult guy had had a similar keychain in the upper movie room with the kids (I think he was a counselor, I don't know who he was, when I first say the keychain I'd thought it was just a cool fashion accessory, I couldn't read it until the store).

5018L,"I was in my bedroom in the house where I lived as a teenager. Several guests were staying over at the house. Most were vague, random DCs, but one was a current colleague, along with his wife and child. [Day residue: I've been meaning to email him for the last couple weeks to check in, so he's been on my mind. In WL he has three children, but apparently this overtaxed my dreaming imagination, so it was reduced to one.]     There was something I wanted to show to the guests, so I invited them into my bedroom. Everyone was sitting together on the bed. [Distortion: in WL it was a tiny daybed pushed up against the wall. In the dream it was magnified to a large king-sized bed in the middle of the room.] The guests appeared uncomfortable, and I realized that this must be because I had covered all the windows and mirrors with paintings that I had made on plywood panels, with the face of the paintings hidden and only the backs showing. This darkened the room and gave it a funereal atmosphere. [DR: I was reading recently about the art installation Die Familie Schneider, and I think the review mentioned that the paintings were turned toward the wall, creating an ominous atmophere.]     I went around the room and removed the paintings from the mirrors and windows, storing them behind the dresser with the images out. They were all self-portraits in various styles. [DR: Last semester I made self-portraits on plywood panels just like this as a class project, though the actual imagery was different in the dream. And just last night I discovered Nina Katchadourian's series Lavatory Self-Portraits in the Flemish Style, some of which were so clever they made me laugh aloud.]     When I removed the painting blocking the window, which was much larger in the dream than it was in life, the view it revealed was gorgeous: a misty landscape with a soft pink glow, so I invited everyone to look. I realized I needed some way to amuse myself while the guests were here, and I wouldn't be able to sustain the attention to read a proper book, so I grabbed a strategy guide to the video game I'm currently playing. [DR: I was reading some online strategy guides to the game last night before bed.]     Suddenly the guests all left the room in a way that felt awkward and abrupt. I wondered what had happened, and realized that I was topless. I had felt so relaxed and casual in my own bedroom that I hadn't thought to cover up in the presence of other people. I didn't feel embarrassed, but I felt sorry that I had apparently embarrassed them. I had neglected to consider that my colleague is a conservative Catholic, and the other guests might have been as well.     I got up to leave the room when I heard my colleague's wife yelling at him just outside the door-apparently they were staying in the closet that was located right outside the room. I decided it would make them more embarrassed if I appeared while they were arguing, so I decided to stay inside until it was finished.     After I sat back down on the bed, two or three women came in. They were archaically dressed as though from some ultra-conservative religious order, and even wore head coverings. [DR: this might also have been influenced by the Katchadourian pictures.] They promptly began remonstrating me for a trio of small works of embroidered text I had on the wall. [DR: Yesterday took note of the sewing sampler in the corner and was also shown a small embroidered bag.]     The women complained that these images were sacred in their religion, and it was wrong of me to have them. I explained that I had found them at Goodwill and recognized that they were sacred, so my intent had been to save them from destruction. [NOTE: I actually dreamed about a thrift store earlier in the night, but cannot confirm if these items were present.]     The women said that the images were meant for a sacred purpose, and if that purpose was no longer fulfilled, then it was right for them to be destroyed. I apologized, and told them that if they wanted, I would give them the images to put back to use or destroy as they saw fit. I reassured them that I understood their point of view, that I was a Buddhist, and so although our beliefs might be very different-I paused to explain that Buddhism does not require any specific beliefs, emphasizing rather the importance of doing the right thing-I had also sometimes felt powers active in the world. I finished the dream with a long theoretical monologue defending animistic attitudes toward both sacred objects and stuffed animals, the sorrow I felt toward both when I saw them abandoned and degraded, and my desire to rescue and redeem them. [DR: The article I read last night talked about the ""biographies of objects"" and included a footnote discussing the articles by Appadurai and Kopytoff that had made a big impression on me in grad school.]    I concluded by using my stuffed toy lion in demonstration. ""This was given to me by a dear friend of the family when I was one or two years old. It has always reminded me of her, and over the years I've imbued it with all the love I felt for her. Now that she's dead, it helps me remember her... and it feels like it has taken on a life of its own."" I looked in the eyes of the toy and was struck to see that they actually gleamed like the eyes of a living creature. The two women nodded sympathetically, and I felt like we had bridged our differences and reached a shared understanding.    ",,

17283S,"I was in my car, with someone, not family, trying to get to a facility, like a mall, conversion center, some large facility that was on a hill. At some point, while stopped At a light, I gave a child on a bike directions for getting to some location. However, we were on a multi lane, divided highway with a raised very large median. I end up in a right hand turning lane with too much traffic to get out of the lane. I have to make the turn, knowing that I have turned too soon ans needed to go one more traffic light further to get to the facility. I am explaining this to the other person in the car, annoyed with myself for the mistake. It means I have to drive back down the other side and come back up to get to the correct right turn. I do know where I am going and have been there before. It just is going to take longer than I wanted to get there.  Self-analysis: This dream made me laugh when I woke up. I have a long history of car dreams and cars always represent my life. I am telling myself that I know where I want to go and how to get there but I should not make the mistake of not paying attention and turning too soon.

Chris said he needed to finish doing something (I forget what) so that I could get back to his ""conquests,"" by which I understood him to mean a list of crushes he wanted to flirt with. He smiled as he said this. Shelley just said ""no."" Chris asked her what she meant. She said ""not if they're all POC"" (people of color). She seemed agitated but said ""we don't need to talk about this now."" Chris seemed taken aback but willingly dropped the subject. Then we were all watching, on an ipad or computer, a RuPaul's drag's race contestant (Honey Davenport, in the costume she was sent home in) talking about dancing to music. Steve messaged me by the pet name he calls me, which showed up on the screen and I went over to him at the dining table. He wanted to do something else but wanted to discreetly get my attention so as not to disturb the group. We decided to leave. I took my dishes with me from the table, but put too many dishes in my hand and spilled a few drops from a small glass cup of milky coffee onto the floor. Darn I thought. I went to the kitchen sink to get a rag to clean up the spill, when I saw Shelley's girlfriend crying to Shelley in the kitchen. I tried to move through the kitchen and dining room quietly so that I wouldn't disturb them. Steve and I walked outside and looked at the garden. We were growing a few crops. Two of the crops were planted together in groups, but the cucumbers were growing freely in the lawn. I lifted the stems from one cucumber plant and saw tiny cucumbers at the end of the plant. I said look, tiny cucumbers!!! in a very soft voice. It had just rained but the plants still looked thirsty. I said that we should water the plants when it's not raining and Steve agreed. The garden and yard were the same as my house growing up on C-- street, and the house was the same too. Chris lived on the entire top floor and I wondered if he could see us. Steve walked over to his tobacco plant. Instead of tobacco, the plant was growing cigarettes. He pulled up a huge handful. I looked at the cigarettes and they had brand names on the paper. The seeds Steve had planted were different types and they had grown into different cigarette brands. I said wow, those all grew? Did you cut them? He said ""no, I just tore them. They're wet. I did it so that I can impress everyone inside."" But I didn't think anyone was inside anymore. I knew Chris was upstairs in his room. I thought again that maybe he could see us. I was wearing sunglasses and my hair up and my old blue dotted dress that I don't have anymore. I wondered if I was one of his ""conquests"" and whether he thought I was attractive. ",,

13968L,"I was in my grandma's house, and a number of strangers were congregated in the living room and kitchen. I walked with my husband to the back of the house, and as we went through the short hall into my grandma's bedroom, I realized this was a dream, although I never became fully lucid. I admired the extent to which the structure of the house had been accurately reproduced, although a lot of the furniture was unfamiliar and wrongly placed. I pointed around the room, telling my husband: ""This is where my grandma's bed used to be, and the TV was there, and that side of the room was a long closet."" He walked toward a corner of the room where the dream had accurately reproduced her dresser, and I saw him dodge an obliquely angled coffee table in the middle of the floor that shouldn't have been there. ""Do you see that too?"" I asked, curious if he was seeing it exactly the way I was dreaming it, given that he had never been in that house. [Dream logic: I was not lucid enough to realize that as a DC, he could not have perceptions independent from my own.]      There was a box in front of a dresser containing a hard drive, and my husband was carrying a different hard drive in a satchel. They contained important information, and I watched as he either switched one for the other, or added the new one to the one he already had. [Day residue: yesterday my husband mailed two hard drives containing important information.] It felt like a spy movie plot, like we had to keep our actions secret. As he was kneeling over the box, there was a knock at the door. We hadn't locked it because we didn't want to seem suspicious, so I hurried over and opened it a crack to see a little girl. I slipped out of the room, only opening the door far enough to let my body through while blocking her view inside, and closed the door behind me so we could talk in the hall. She said she wanted me to make her more warm milk (apparently I had done so earlier). Although she was affecting a childish tone, I thought she seemed older than her years, and suspected that her real intentions had been to find out what we were up to. I deliberately led the girl away from the room and toward the kitchen, hoping to give my husband enough time to finish up whatever he was doing with the hard drives.      I found a saucepan in the sink that was not ideal for heating milk (too shallow), but figured I could make do, and tried to wash it, but it was covered with stubborn grease and stuck-on food so I gave up. I was in a hurry to rejoin my husband, so I tried giving the girl a mug of cold milk from the fridge. She complained that she wanted it warmed, so I stuck the mug in the microwave and set the timer for two minutes. I told her to get it out herself when it was done, or ask another adult to get it for her if she couldn't reach, because I needed to go. My husband had come into the kitchen so we affected a casual demeanor but walked straight out the front door and got into a silver, futuristic-looking car in the driveway. This part was tense because we thought it was only a matter of time before someone caught on and tried to stop us. But we drove the car quickly up the rural road into the woods, and once we were out of sight of the house, we set it on flight mode and took off into the sky.     There was a bit of proceduralism here where I OOCly tried to figure out if the car needed a straight bit of road like a runway or to reach a certain speed before taking off. I decided I should stop overthinking things and just allow that we were flying now, and it was so. Since dream awareness was heightened again at this point, and I wondered if I should just skip ahead to our destination or play through the whole journey. The dream seemed stable and flying was fun, so I decided to go along with it. Our destination was somewhere in Vermont, and I was trying to think how long it would actually take to reach it from where we had started in central southern New York. I remembered how long it used to take to drive to Montreal from central New York and figured this journey might be roughly the same length, but a flying car might quarter the travel time. Because of the current of my thoughts I think the destination was revised to Montreal, but the world below was urban and futuristic so the destination was an abstraction anyway. I wondered if my husband had programmed our flight path into the computer or if, to avoid the risk of surveillance, he was navigating by hand.     For a while the car was flying low over a dystopian city, and at times we were practically in the streets. There were various encounters that I don't clearly remember. And then we were back in the air and passing over parking garages that had been designed for flying cars: they contained a black geometric pattern that operated like a QR code as our vehicle passed over it, so that our screen prompted us to enter landing coordinates, but at the same time warned that these would reveal our position to the authorities. So we took care not to fly directly over these buildings.   ",,

I was with a group of friends I didn't know walking along a sidewalk of a quad (not my alma mater's) at night and there were people on either side of the sidewalk gathering around fires. I met a guy who seemed familiar and I think I knew his sister. I went home with him (I've never gone home with a complete stranger IRL) and found that he'd bought my parents' house. I woke up the next morning and he was outside grilling something for breakfast (anything other than my room (which was now his) didn't follow the layout of my parents' house IRL). His sister came in and told me that I could take my time to think about things and then go down, and he'd make me whatever I wanted for breakfast.  I wasn't sure if I'd see them downstairs or if I'd sneak out. As soon as she left, my best friend Sam (who grew up in the same city, we've been friends since I was 13, though it's easily been 5-8+ years since she's been to my parents' house) was there (I don't think she'd been with me the night before). I walked into the closet, and saw that, though in the dream my mom had told me to make sure I'd cleaned everything out of my childhood closet before they sold the house, that a lot of books and my old stuffed animals were still there. I started trying to pack as many of the ones I'd want to make space to keep at my house as possible. There were some books that I didn't recognize from IRL but that I realized looked of interest / like they'd be pretty to display, but that were also ones I'd left behind. Sam was helping me pack up, and asked questions about some things (the closet was about 200% it's normal size, as it's a fairly small walk-in with only room for one adult to be in there.

Then I was in an apartment, serving dinner and wine to my cousin and her parents, my parents were there too. They wanted to catch the last bus bus I told them we would go drive them back, knowing that my parents would not offer it and wanted them to take the bus. I felt bad either way, they stayed.  My younger cousin was also there. I offered him chocolate milk, it came out white - he said no. Then he asked a question but it was really hard to understand what he was saying, it sounded like a dolphin.  At some point I was in a school, i was dressed in a halloween costume, a black tee shirt with a pumpkin on it - I ran into my two friends, when they saw me with my little pot I was carrying they said: coffee?? I opened it and it was only a bunch of cigarettes - I said sorry, those are my dad! (he's not smoking), he leaves at my place for now.    Later I was in Peru, it was getting late, I was with Anne on a trip. It was as if someone was filming us, a movie.

For some reason I expected it to happen in that place. I had dressed carefully and I was wearing a brownish-orange jumper and I knew I looked nice and Larry David even said ""oh I like your jumper."" He was behaving thoughtfully, out of character for him,  flirting with me, and then he started to get friendly and then we sat down together and he leaned in to kiss me and he opened his mouth wide as he leaned in which I thought was odd and then when we kissed his mouth was really cold and I thought oh this is unpleasant, maybe it will get better and then I started to wonder did I regret this? and then in another scene we were all walking down a long, wide ancient hallway with a big crowd of people and in front of me was a cute dark-skinned teenaged girl in a black swimming suit and she was very small and thin but she had a slightly flabby body that everyone could see because she was exposed in the swimming suit but she had the obliviousness of youth and I was worried that I was going to have to be naked in front of someone (namely Larry David) and it wasn't going to be good. Walking down the hall, I could see it was very large and ancient building but it was filled with junk & storage and it was crowded. It was sort of a cross between the Vatican and the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston. The crowd was going somewhere for some event that was happening; everyone was walking there through the hallway. I was one of the crowd and I don't know what happened to Larry David but even though the hall was crowded and slow- moving and I didn't really know what was at the end of it, I was relieved I wouldn't have to go home with him and start worrying about what he wanted to do, eat for dinner, wash his clothes or any of that.

We could smell the carcass from just on the other side of the trail, separated by a bush. It stank like hot meat. I was so scared we would run into the bear and thought what a terrible idea it was to use this trail.¬†    Next dream: I was in the grocery store with my mom. As we entered the soaps were nearby, so I took some body wash and gave it to my mom. Then in a different section I saw huge gallon jugs of Dr. Bronner's for only $8 so I thought I should get that instead. But then I saw that it was unscented and I looked for the lavender, which I found near baby food. Then I thought I would just get the one I had already and buy Dr. Bronner's some other time. We kept walking because what we actually needed was food. We were carrying some items in our hands and I looked around for a shopping basket. I saw an empty cart in the middle of the aisle and as I walked up to it, I saw that two grocery store workers were right next to it. They were wearing scrubs, as if they were nurses. They both had facemasks on. I asked if I could use the cart and they just sort of looked at me and walked away, very close together. I didn't see them wipe the cart handle and I didn't have anything to use as a barrier so I just used my hands. I decided I wouldn't touch anything else. I looked in a refrigerated or frozen food section and saw that it was filled with take-out pizza boxes from various pizza places. All the pizzas had toppings written on them in black sharpie and I realized that they were pizzas that people hadn't picked up, and that the pizza places had donated to the grocery store. I looked down the aisle and the entire aisle was filled with pizzas. Mom I said, let's just get a bunch of pizzas. I wondered if all of them were unclaimed pizzas or if the pizza places had made some pizzas just for the grocery store. Then I was with Ali C., and she was mad at me because I convinced her to eat pizza for lunch. She regretted it because the pizza had gluten and it made her bloat. I was not convinced because she does not have Celiac disease. She was wearing a bright red outfit. She looked in the mirror before leaving the house and her stomach was bloated. I said yeah, but you also ate really fast (we were on a lunch break). Eating fast can make you bloat, too. As I said this I thought how smart I sounded, and Ali seemed impressed, too.¬†    Next dream: I was in my bedroom and discovered an owl had made a nest under a table. There was a baby owl, and it started walking around the room exploring, apparently not afraid of me. The mother owl was a bit more cautious and followed her owlet around as it explored. I closed my room door to keep the owls inside, but not before a small black kitty ran out from behind a cabinet and out the door. I found an email from Mike K. that was a small shred of paper with ""How's it going?"" written on it. I began writing back to him on a notepad by my door. I started the letter but wasn't sure what to write. I looked behind me and the owlet was perched on something by the window near me. It was an eastern screech owl. There was a terrible storm outside with fierce winds and bitter cold. The owl looked very comfortable sitting inside. I wondered whether once it goes back to the wild it would have a hard time adjusting, and whether it might be best if it was outside now weathering the storm. Just then a huge mass of snow fell through the treetops onto the ground just outside the window. I thought, at least it is staying alive through this storm; and by the time it fledges it will be summer and it won't have to worry about snowstorms.¬†    Next dream: Tess R. was making a movie about her family based on a book she had written, and I was watching scenes from her life/the movie. They decided to use her parents' real house, which was very expensive looking but tasteful, with high ceilings and modern furniture. I saw her real parents, who looked to be in their late 50s, discovering that they were having another baby. Then everyone was at a restaurant celebrating her brother's new job. This time the characters were played by actors. The person playing Tess looked like Helen S., and I thought it was weird that they would cast a white actor. At Tess' table, someone across from her said that Tess just faded into the background, and that it's so easy not to notice her. Tess/Helen became upset and just as the party was ending, after her brother had made some remarks, she said loudly, ""Mom. Don't you want to tell them about the baby?"" The parents were white now, too. Tess' brother's friend sitting next to him, who looked like Linda R., asked him, ""are they having a baby?"" He scoffed and said ""no."" The mom, who was stout and had a pixie cut, smiled and said, ""Yes, we're having a baby!"" Tess' brother got very upset and maybe even cried. He looked like the killer character in Marcella. His friend/Linda consoled him.¬†",,

Later on, she came to me saying that she scratched one of those glasses and the company was coming after here for the money to fix the them. I was trying to help her with the lawsuit. Finally, I was at this school and there was something about love letters. I think someone died or disappeared, and everyone wanted evidence to what had happened. I had the letters and one other piece of evidence that I don't remember, and I kept trying to tell everyone that the evidence was in a TV show so they could get it themselves, but people kept coming after me.

I was there to return a library book. So I'd give the library book to him in one hand and then in his other hand he had the new book I was picking up.

I walked up the avenue and passed a beautiful, gingerbready building with a slate but iridescent roof. It had large plate glass windows which were abnormally clean. The door was partway open and I looked in to see Nigerians dancing and singing in prayer. But. The men were in Boy Scout uniforms with cloth of  Nigerian designs inset. Inwalked further up the avenue and stopped in a store to buy something, then headed back to the hotel. On the other side of the avenue I saw a store with a sign that said something like 'please Asian customers, come in, you may think you will not like our food, but you will'.  I went back into the ballroom and sat down. I realized I had gotten up originally to get a glass of ice and some sliced turkey, but had gotten neither. My father and my husband were eating from shallow bowls containing chopped lettuce in one section, chopped tomatoes and cheddar cheese in another and pasta with no sauce in a third. They both were picking out bits and putting them in my plate. Then I was suddenly back, peering into the Nigerian church.

I decided to finally go downstairs and tried to rub in the cream so it wouldn't look so white. But the cream had dried and wasn't budging. So I had to use some water to loosen it and wash it off. I think first, before this, I had been talking to Lauren about a job, maybe to say I wanted to come back. So then later, my boss turned into another woman with two short bob wigs, one white underneath and a black one on top. I went to see her at the front door. Everyone was scared of her but I was determined to be her friend. Something happened at the front door to make her laugh and we got off on the right foot. We took a walk down the street arm in arm. As we walked I saw a big brown bear in the middle of the road. A bear! I said. As we took each step we saw more bears. Ten, I said. They were all sitting in a wooden shelter with benches. Then as we were watching them I realized that one of them was a little boy, not a bear. Then I realized that they were all people. I laughed and felt so confused and embarrassed. We talked about it.

Some lady stopped us on the street and told us we were dressed funny. I pieced together that we'd actually somehow travelled back in time to 1980 and we had all this modern stuff on us (I had a backpack with a new laptop and a tablet in it). She showed us an FBI badge and I took off running in the opposite direction. She left the other guy and started chasing me.

I saw four planes in all: at 10pm, 2am, 3am, and 4am. They were being stealthy, but I got a good look at one of them, the third I think, and saw some writing on the side. There was a date, either 1961 or 1969 (my recollection was already uncertain within the dream, when I tried to describe this to my mother). I felt agitated about the planes because I did not know why they were there, but I had a feeling they were surveilling us.

It looked like a very nice old apartment with pretty details on the outside. I saw it was listed for $700,000 and I called Steve to tell him about it. Then I was inside for a showing, alone. The kitchen was the first room inside and it was half demolished. The stove wasn't there. I walked further in and saw a small bathroom and a dining room, and then a bedroom down a long hallway. I walked into the bedroom and it was very dark. Everything was very dimly lit. There were two cats on the bed and I said hi. They seemed comfortable so I pet them and they were both exceptionally soft. I kept wondering if I would see the owner but they weren't there. I walked back to the front of the apartment and realized I didn't see a bathroom except the one at the front, and since the apartment was so long it didn't make sense not to have one at the back. I decided to do another walk through looking for a second bathroom. I saw a door near the front that said water something, so I opened it and it was a huge cavernous concrete room with a big pool of water at the middle. It looked like an unfinished basement. I saw a toilet at the back and a rat crawling into it. I quickly closed the door. It was a maintenance area. I walked down the hallway and heard water trickling, like a shower. I wondered if the owner was home and taking a shower. I opened a closet next to the bedroom thinking it might be the second bathroom but there was nothing there. I started walking back and saw a door with a note saying ""dear prospective buyers, this is a newly renovated bathroom."" I opened the door and saw a plain concrete room with a toilet. The paint was peeling. It looked like the public bathrooms at the beach. I closed the door quickly and wanted to leave. The rat in the other room made me feel uncomfortable.

The bathroom was surrounded by all windows and I guess I thought that was a great idea. we followed the water downstairs somehow and I found out it flowed straight into the ocean. There was a lot of people gathered where the water flowed out and there was a huge turtle without a shell :( the front of the skyline apartments was actually a kids j crew or gap store.

I ended up going and leaving my husband to pack, but when I got home late that night he was asleep and hadn't done a thing. I stayed up all night packing, and the next day the new tenants were at our front door at 8am instead of noon, but with just backpacks, and my roommates were still missing.

Then his wife and kids joined up, and wife was very pregnant with baby #4 (which she's not - they have 3 kids).

9266S,"I was my current age, but also living with my parents again (I haven't lived with them since I was 23 and working at two different offices - my parents' house was in the middle of the two locations). They were fostering a little girl (3-4 years old) who was black (my family is white; it surprised me that they'd taken in a non-white child, because my dad is somewhat racist but moreso re: Muslims living in Middle Eastern counties, and Latinx immigrants to the U.S. - he watches Fox News).  I was spending a lot of time with her, she was so sweet. For some reason I was at church for an event that had us arrive in the daytime, but it took a bit to find parking, I had to ask some older church members to move their towel from a spot (it was laid out like someone was laying out to tan). Then it was nighttime, and I must have taken the little girl inside the church for childcare because I was alone, but I had a bicycle (I haven't had a bicycle for 15+ years, and haven't ridden a non-stationary bicycle in 5-6+ years) that I needed find space to park as well. I didn't have a bike lock, but no one else seemed to have one either, they'd just used the bike rack or leaned their bikes against a chain link fence. I didn't think that was a good idea, but I didn't have another option, I needed to get back to the little girl, and hoped that maybe no one would steal from a church parking lot. I went inside the church, and appeared to have missed the event I'd gone there to attend by a wide margin, and knew that I was late to pick up the little girl from child care. I picked her up and held her close, and she seemed to forgive me, even as I felt terrible about perhaps her feeling forgotten as well as making the childcare staff stay late. Someone asked me if she was my by-blow, which made me angry because of the word's implications (IRL I've never heard it used in a non-historical context), but I held that in and just said that my parents were fostering her. I helped clear up some dirty dishes left around on tables (apparently I'd missed a dinner of some sort, though the disarray of the dishes surprised me because at this church IRL there's a dedicated space for everyone to drop off dishes for the kitchen to make things easier for those volunteering in the kitchen). Then I was sitting on the floor with my foster sister, and another woman (who was maybe providing childcare during the event I'd missed?) sitting on a chair at a table and I were discussing leg hair, I think the other woman had shaven more recently, but I stretched out my leg and let my foster sister feel the short hair on my calf from not having shaved as recently as the other woman (IRL I either would shave my legs or wouldn't have bare legs in public) because she was curious. I think I was trying to give my foster sister a example that it's equally okay to shave or not shave body hair? I was holding my foster sister on my hip and trying to figure out if she needed a new diaper.",,

5371S,"I was on a bicycle trip in South America. I got to a very long bridge over some water. The bridge was just for cyclists and pedestrians. I started to bike on it but it was full of large gaps. Pedestrians were walking carefully but didn't seem to mind. I kept going, wondering if I was going to fall and terrified. I kept feeling like I could bike over the edge so easily, because there was so much space on the sides too. It was a bridge I had been on before, on a trip with Jake. Finally I got over the bridge and started biking on a highway, which was scary for a second until I realized there was a bike lane that went into the woods. It was so nice to bike in South America! Then later, I was in a used bookstore (perhaps separate dream?). I hung out there all the time and the owners knew me. One of the owners might have been my friend Conor. Then one day it was the last day they were open and they were having a sale. I picked up some Jane Austen books for my mom. But when I called her later to tell her, I realized I had forgotten to get the Jane Austen memoir and some other Jane Austen book. I went back to the bookstore at night after they had closed and there was a group of teenagers hanging out in the basement. I told them about the bridge in South America. We decided to leave the bookstore, but decided that we would first clean up. There was a piece of old exercise equipment that we de-assembled and put back into the original boxes it came in and some plastic bags. We opened the closets in the basement and found someone's old clothes. They were all vintage baby clothes. Now Steve was with me, and it was his apartment. There was a railing full of matching Hanna Anderson pajamas for a baby and mom. They were all christmas patterns. And I said, hey, those are from that photo shoot that mom did with her baby. We figure she probably didn't want the pajamas back. At the top of the closet, there was a shelf full of knick-knacks left behind by old tenants. I got on a stool or something and saw in the back a bowl full of old Japanese coins and we realized that they were Darcy's when she lived here. I put the coins in a bag and some of them were tiny, like 2 mm in diameter. I showed Steve. There was a bowl of nylon flowers too, and I told Steve that every time I look at them I think -- and then I started singing ""Rejang Renteng"" because of the flowers in the dance. There was more on the shelf from a different tenant. Then the bridge in South America became part of a movie I was watching, and the protagonist of the movie, who was a girl with short brown hair, was looking for a man. She found her friend, but while they were together she heard a man she didn't like on the other side of the park they were in, and she walked over abruptly to confront him. He saw her on the other side of a tall iron fence, and as she walked toward him he threw a knife at her and it went straight through her chest. She fell backward and I gasped. ",,

When we got to wherever we were going, Ben told me that his seatmate had knit him a pair of socks, but that they only got halfway through. He showed me the socks. They were both just the part of the sock that go over your ankles. I thought it was hilarious but also sweet and exciting. I sort of screamed. The socks were colorful and had writing knitted into them. It was very impressive. Then I was looking at magazines, and then I had to go home. I put the magazines in a plastic storage container and looked for the lid. I found the lid in a pile, towards the bottom and broken. Then I remembered that I had broken the lid while carrying it here. I put the lid on and the lid wouldn't close and the container was filled with water.    Different dream: I was buying weed online from wherever my roommates get their weed. They get their weed delivered but I decided to go pick it up. I went up to the storefront, which was in a parking lot, and some men came out with tons of bags of weed. I was worried that someone would see.     Another dream fragment, I think before these two dreams: I was playing a song from the Blow, but not Parentheses.     Another very vague dream fragment: I think I was at a party and people were either ignoring me or mad at me. It might have been part of the Ben Gross dream. ",,

I asked Conner if he had any recommendations for dinner places. He said something like I would definitely join you, and I was pleasantly surprised - I was considering inviting them but assumed they would not be interested. Then I thought it made sense that he would want to join us because my mom was being very funny and entertaining. And I said do you both want to join us? And they said yes. Either on the train or on the way to the restaurant, maybe going over a bridge, I was walking with Conner and we were talking about our work schedules. I told him I have a trick for Saturdays, and he said oh do you want to write together?? And I said maybe dismissively, and continued with my story. I said I just write plain, generic sentences (like ""first you do x, then you do y"") and fill them in with relevant information. Then I end up with a lot of material that I can edit later. At the restaurant we sat in a circle on the floor. It was a bit like a traditional Japanese room. Conner said I have some stuff of yours to give you, and pulled out a handful of necklaces and little clear plastic bags full of jewelry from his brown shoulder bag. It was all of my jewelry that I had been missing! I looked quickly through the pile to see if my watch was there and it was! I said I've been looking for this for years! I put it up to my ear and could hear it ticking. I said it's still ticking! But the time was off and I knew I needed to get it repaired. I found the two necklaces I had been looking for too, and they were tangled together. I thought it was odd that Conner had been carrying these things in his bag all these years when he had no reason to think we'd see each other. Then (maybe separate dream?) I was on my way from a hotel to a boat heading to Greece. I looked down and saw my comb and some other bathroom stuff in my coat pocket. I had packed a little backpack and had stuffed a jacket on top so I didn't want to unpack everything to check to see if my toiletries were in there, so I decided to head back to the hotel to check if my things were there. My friend Amy kept going to the boat with some others. We had ten minutes before the boat was scheduled to leave. I thought I would hurry and run back and make it in time. As I went up the stairs to the hotel room I saw the door open and the main cleaning up. I thought she didn't waste any time getting in there since I had just left. I don't remember looking for my bathroom things but as I was leaving I couldn't find my keys. I looked all around and saw the maid on the computer playing a game, maybe solitaire. I found sets of keys on a windowsill that my mom had left and decided to take those. But when I tried them in the lock I realized none of them contained the right keys. I looked at the time and it was one minute past when the boat was supposed to leave. I hoped that Amy was making sure they didn't leave without me. I decided to just leave and have the main lock the doors behind me. As I went out the door there were cats trying to get in. I shooed them away and we all went down the stairs together. I'm just now realizing that the hotel had the same exact layout as the house I lived in in high school, and the hotel room was where our apartment was. As I opened the front door one cat tried to escape. I took out my cell phone but I had two identical ones and didn't know which one belonged to me. They were both old silver flip phones. One of them had a message from Amy so I figured that one was mine. I tried to call her but didn't know how. ",,

Normally I would have walked there but that would take about fifteen minutes and there wasn't time. It must have been about 8:37.     A car pulled up that I recognized from its green livery as the local transport service (I didn't think of it as a taxi, but it wasn't really rideshare since I hadn't summoned it with an app.) I figured a car could get me to my destination in about five minutes so it would be worth the few bucks in fare, and got in. The driver was a friendly blonde woman.    The road took us to the outer edge of the city, bordering some hills on the right, and the driver pointed out the castle of a guy who was apparently a local bigwig. I looked and was struck by the architecture: the castle appeared to have been built out of brightly colored monsters.     As we continued, we approached something even more alarming on the left. It was a massive crater, incredibly wide and deep, with sheer vertical sides. Houses were built all around it, and apparently our destination was among them. The road was too close to the edge of the crater for my comfort, and there were no guardrails, though I saw that big nets hung down from the side. If we accidentally drove in, the car would probably fall into one of those nets and then we would have to wait to be rescued. I could also see that there were more houses on the very bottom of the crater, several hundred meters down.    I had the address of the destination and we approached the right street, but the driver was confused and couldn't find the right house. It was now 8:52 and I was annoyed at being late, but I reminded myself that it was just an orientation, not a class, so it probably didn't matter that much.   ",,

I asked him suspiciously what he was doing there, and he said he had come to arrange a garage sale of our things. When I told him we had no interest in that, he said my brother had invited him. I asked my mom and dad in turn if they knew about this, and neither did, so I angrily confronted my brother about inviting a stranger into our house to rummage through our stuff. I absolutely refused to let that man in the house, and I was so furious that I took an object I knew my brother valued, something that resembled a short pool cue, and snapped it over my knee. I felt a pang of regret when I did this because it was something that could not be taken back, and would only make things worse, but I was so angry that I still felt partly justified in doing it.     [Note: The emotional resonance of the dream was peculiar, because I've don't think I've ever had this kind of dramatic fight with my brother or anyone else, much less destroyed an object someone cared about-destroying objects goes against my core values. But I can connect the dream to a very minor incident that occurred last night: we were eating dinner and watching TV when we heard the door to the garage latching shut. My husband looked into the garage and found it empty, though the door was unlocked. I had just been in the garage a little earlier, so we deduced that I had not closed the door properly and some change in air pressure had finally pushed it to latch shut. But my imagination had already supplied the threat of an imaginary intruder-hence the fact that the dream figure was not only trying to get into the house but was organizing a ""garage sale."" Ironically (given my defensive attitude in the dream), after the actual incident I quipped to my husband that the hypothetical intruder was welcome to whatever we had out there, because the garage is so full of crap.]   ",,

He goes into the men's no problem but as soon as I open the door to the women's a horde of rats run out. I decide to go to the college library's cafe bathroom instead. Somehow I end up there and I get a lot of weird looks as I walk past college students in my full costume. I don't really mind because I would do the same thing in their shoes. I don't do anything in the bathroom other than look at my face with the upturned nose and crazy makeup. Louis bangs on the door and it's time to go. When I open the door Louis tells me that my uncle is looking for me. Louis is out of his costume and makeup, and it makes me a little sad to be the only one dressed up. Somehow the dream morphs and I'm in a castle in Germany where my uncle apparently lives. My orc makeup is gone and I'm in a fluffy white dress that feels like a cloud. I'm in the library and there's a nice fire going. The library looks very modern for being in a 16th century castle and I ask the librarian for my uncle so I can tell him that. She doesn't answer me. I go to my favorite spot and it's full of coloring books and Winnie the Pooh stuffed animals. I start leafing through the coloring books and most of the pages are half colored in with the same bright pink color, as if I had just taken a ruler straight down the page and only colored one side. It slightly annoys me, but I'm not surprised and eventually I get a little let down when a page isn't half colored pink. I think I felt let down because the uncolored pages were boring and I'd rather try to color an interesting half than a boring whole. Before I can start coloring though my mom walks in. She looks pretty fancy which is surprising but cool. I told her she looked great and she practically beamed. She told the librarian that I was leaving and the librarian looked angry, but I happily leave with my mom and we drive down a snowy hill. ",,

I saw a whirlpool and knew I shouldn't fall into or near it, so I pantomime flying to gain distance and manage to fall into the ocean just out of reach of the whirlpool. I sunk deep, holding my breath into the cold, dark, muddy water and came up gasping for air and trying to keep from drowning when suddenly there appeared three young males swimming beside me and yelling to give them my hand. A wash of relief came over me and I reached for the closest one and he grasped my hand and pulled me to him, then all three took my arms and like dolphins swam towards shore with me. As we neared shore there was a stairway in the rocks leading up to a wooden shack. The boys helped me climb the stairs because my legs felt very weak and they told me to go on into the shack. I opened the door and an old fisherman was standing at a wood burning stove, he turned and yelled, ""Who goes there?!"". I weakly said, ""I'm sorry but I need help.""

Once we reached the bottom, we anchored out on a lake. I had to climb back up to meet my siblings and one of my cousins. Once I met them, the only way down was through the waterfalls again. We wouldn't have a boat this time. I braced them for what was about to happen as much as I could. My sister wasn't listening and she just went for it down the waterfalls. She was fine though. My cousin had been listening, and he went down somehow without falling from the waterfalls. My brother told me there was a porcupine beneath me in the water. I kind of freaked out and tried to swim away without brushing against the quills. The porcupine followed me and nuzzled my leg. It was a friendly porcupine, but I still didn't like it very much, so my brother and I went down the waterfalls together and left the porcupine at the top. My aunts and uncles and two of my archaeology supervisors were waiting at the bottom. We all climbed onto the little boat and headed for a small channel that led from the lake to the ocean. On our way we found an empty field to make camp for the night, since there were so many of us. My uncle got sick and isolated himself in some trees. We shouted conversation to him. In the morning, we found a stage and lidar equipment. We surveyed the area and found my great great great grandfathers beaver hat. On the stage we took turns modeling the hat to see who it fit best. Then my dream changed. I was alone in a small mountain town. Coffee shops were just starting to open again and I was so excited! I made a map of all the coffee shops and decided to go to each and order one thing. I had the best oatmeal muffin of my life at the first coffee shop. When I reached the last one on the map I was almost out of money so I just ordered a small plain coffee. The man behind me paid for it. He was super attractive! I handed him back his card and smiled. He didn't say anything but smiled back. We walked back more into the coffee shop with our drinks together because the hallway was narrow. I found a small high rise table and started to pull out a chair when the guy motioned for me to join his table of friends. His friends were just as attractive and so nice!

The floor was slanted and it was hard to stand, it was like the gravity was off and was pulling me into the room and toward the back. Someone had to help pull me back out of the bathroom. My cat was in the car, it was an orange like my childhood cat. I Ran my dad's credit card to purchase the outfit. The shoes I picked out we're a pair I felt like I had bought before and really liked, but they were pointed tip pumps which I don't think look good on me. We were in an unfamiliar town that I didn't recognize, staying at hotel. Some sort of exclusive party going on at the hotel; I was worried I would get ""caught"" for being somewhere I wasn't supposed to be even though I had a room there. I Finally got inside my room and the cat drank lots of water. The water in the car was in a container that was to deep and seemed too warm from being in the car for the cat to drink.

I recognized him as a good friend from back in high school who I haven't seen in many years. He was so close I feel his breath on my face as he spoke, and it provoked an ambivalent reaction. I knew I should tell him to stand further away, but I was enjoying the closeness, so I hesitated.     ""It's only risky if he has the virus,"" I thought, then reminded myself, ""But I can't know that... that's why it's risky.""   ",,

NOTE: I recorded the following when I woke up in the middle of the night-not sure what it means:  The woman was going to come back and tell her story and reveal a secret, she was an older relative of Laurie's [I don't really know who ""Laurie"" is] who killed herself after the last concert",,
19566S,"I was sitting in a classroom and the professor told me that I had to take over his class for the term; it was an administrative reorganization. He gave me a piece of paper like a worksheet for notes on the lecture. I began filling it out, thinking of an example to begin the lecture. The lecture was on something about culture. I felt like I could do it, that I didn't need much time to prepare. Then I realized that I needed to create my own lecture slides. But I thought I could put those together quickly once I made my plan on this paper. I went to the bathroom and I had a packet of bagel crackers with me which I put on top of something, maybe a trash can or heater, that was near the paper towels, and then went into a stall. I was hungry and realized I only had an hour or two before the lecture. From my stall (through my stall) I could see a girl pick up my packet of bagels with a confused look, sniff them, and taste one. I said hey, put that down, that's my bagel! She said why is it near the paper towels? That's unsanitary. I yelled at her through the stall. Unsanitary? Do you think germs leap from the bagel to the paper towels? I said other mean things. I felt out of control with anger. I lifted up a little bit from the toilet seat to reach the toilet paper and my poop fell to the ground. The girl's friend was looking underneath the stall and pointed at the poop with wide eyes, laughing. I picked up the poop and worried that the girls might be in my class. I walked out of the stall and there was a short woman in a security officer's uniform. I realized the friend had called security because of our argument. The security guard seemed to realize that things were settling down and that she wasn't needed. I looked back and there was a big crowd of women watching us. I washed my hands and felt regret and scared that I had made a terrible impression, especially if these girls were in my class. I said to the girl, hey, I was really out of line and I'm sorry. I guess I'm pretty stressed out. And I'm hungry. And you were eating my bagel! But that's no excuse for what I did. I added, I know that sometimes when someone apologizes to you it's easy to accept the apology on the spot, but if you sleep on it and want to revisit this conversation later I'm totally open to that. The girls seemed happy to hear what I was saying but surprised. As I was leaving I saw my blue enamel plate in the trash. I left it not wanting to stir up anything else, but as I walked down the hall I worried that someone would come take the trash out and my plate would be gone forever. Then I realized I only had half an hour until the lecture. I had to find a computer lab to make my PowerPoint slides. I thought I would ask the prof for his slides with the examples of racism being categories, which was the main part of the lecture. I took my phone out as I crossed a bridge to another building outside, but remembered that I hadn't set up gmail on my phone yet and decided I would email him when I found a computer. I hoped he wasn't eating dinner and would see my message before the lecture. He had told me earlier, in the classroom, that racial categories were a lot like phone numbers, the way we lump three digits together and make groups. I got to the second floor research area and the door was locked. As I got my keys out Andriy and Hanbin arrived too. The area looked dark and empty. Andriy said it looked empty, but there was a lecture and people were probably there. Yeah I said, and I need to make the slides for it!! I ran down the hall but couldn't find the computer lab. I had misremembered where it was. I was trying to figure out the best one to go to when I woke up.",,

The scene changed, I was in this apartment/hotel suite, my brother was there, and so were some other people, and 1-3 cats had their space to sleep in the bathtub (my brother and I are both allergic enough to cats that we take OTC allergy meds when we know we're going to be around them). My room was small compared to the rest of the more open concept space and had a door, I saw the cats with the shower curtain drawn to encourage them to stay there, and a black and white cat was perched on the edge and I was telling it to stay there (in elementary school I had a beloved similar-looking stuffed animal that's been consigned to my childhood bedroom closet at my parents' house for the past approx. 20 years; after dreaming about Stockings three nights ago, I mentioned the dream to my parents, and my dad has teased me the past two days about how I should bring her over to my apartment because she missed me, made plaintive cat noises over the phone, and sent me a photo of her yesterday).

The scene changed and some people who were my coworkers/friends (but that I don't think I know IRL) were getting married, and a group of 10+ or so of us needed to figure out this puzzle on a computer system that seemed like it was supposed to be for work to figure out secrets about the couple getting married (the sense was more ominous than light-hearted fun) to either send them on a honeymoon to France, or something bad would happen. At one point I was working on a task alongside the line of computer's that involved having to arrange flowers in a certain ""right"" way based upon the clues I'd learned though without any other guidance re: what the correct arrangement was (the flowers were various hues mostly of yellow and orange, some were red or pinkish purple). There was also something about a system update where the different versions were [I don't remember what], T1, and T3 - T3 sent medical records directly to our computer so we had them instantly, but the other versions we still had to ask for them (this is more IRL tangentially related to work). Someone (maybe a manager or person of authority on our project?) asked me how I was doing figuring things out, and I said it was going well. We left the computer room (possibly in a library?) And went outside where it was dark and pouring rain, our group was larger than before standing underneath the semicircular roof area by the buses, we would need to get wet from the rain to get to the bus, and that would be bad for most of us, but worse for the people getting married (I don't know why). I somehow got back home (not my real home), it was a subby, early morning, and knew that I had two young sons (I don't have children and have never been pregnant; my older cousin has two boys under 5-years-old that I video chatted with in the past two weeks), and my mom (but not my real mom) had taken them overnight without telling me (though I wouldn't have been there the night before, I think). I was walking around an open floor plan first floor that showed clear evidence of children (ex. toys and small plastic cups vs. the glass cups I have IRL). I was apprehensive waiting for my kids but excited to see them. Something about how either they knew part of or couldn't find out about the work mystery. My not-real-mom brought the boys back, and I knew something about the boys' father was bad, he'd done something related to the work mystery and there was something weird and evil about his teeth (he either had more than the expected number of Jaws, or a scary long line of dentures that he slid up and down or something; my semi-annual dentist appointment was scheduled to have been this past Friday, but is postponed indefinitely until my dentist's office is open for non-emergency care). I had to find him, and went to a basement store I knew was seedy with a bouncer at the door and red lights in the window.

I took an elevator and realized that I needed to go back, so when we got to the second floor, I got off, but instead of going back down to the main floor, I went out the door as I was a tourist and had never seen this area before.  There were a lot of steps.  I stumbled on the first one, as I didn't know it was there and then I walked up and down them.  There was really nothing to see except some type of shop that sold souvenir types of things, and I didn't think I had much money since I only had my one purse.  My money was in the other purse that I left behind.  Then I saw a teenager with my large blue crocheted purse.  I told her it was my purse and to give it back. She said she had bought it someplace, but I told her no, she hadn't, because I had made it.  Then she said ok and gave it to me.

It flew off chasing its prey and everyone ran after it. I saw another eagle in the sky, likely its mate. I ran to Beth and asked, ""Did you see the eagle?"" I didn't say hello or acknowledge that we hadn't seen each other in a long time; I was just so excited about the eagle.   I think a different dream: Steve and I reached a lake with a beach. We walked down sandy steps to the beach and walked past families who looked at us as we walked by. Children were swimming in the water. As we walked the water met our feet. ""The water's so warm!"" I said. We didn't have anything with us and I started swimming into the water. Steve did too, but he had an ice cream cone in his hand that he was trying not to get wet.

I was, uncharacteristcally for me, running late on the last day, packing and tidying,  & just when I was going to leave for the airport and go back to Boston (where I was I don't know-Sibel lives in Boston) in the morning when I was supposed to leave as I was cleaning up, I found a lot of laundry that needed to be done and some towels that needed to be washed, and I stuffed everything in a laundry bag. The bus to the airport was leaving at 8:37 and it was  already 8:20 as I was about to go out the door and I was afraid there was no time to get to the bus station and wanted someone to come & help take me there but I was frantic because I couldn't find any bus ticket and I had to go to the bus station and then to the airport ....this was in either Boston or I was going to Boston- then I remembered to look on my phone for an email with ticket but I couldn't find my phone and I had to go back to Fresno (California) a place where I partially grew up & absolutely detest, so I was upset and my mom (died 1982) was there in the family house in Fresno and I didn't know how I was going to get back to Boston then I remembered I had a paper airline ticket for American Airlines I recalled & it should have included the return ticket on it- why didn't I think of that and I was very upset that I had to stay in Fresno and I wondered if I could just get to the airport in San Francisco before the flight time if I found my airline ticket. Everything was packed so tightly I wondered if I would be able to find it let alone get everything stuffed back in the bags after taking it out to look for the ticket. I didn't know what to do, it was awful, my sister Nancy was there and she was now the younger sister instead of the older sister in the house (in reality I moved back to the Fresno area from Boston to look after her because she was not in good health and had terrible financial difficulties). The house was unnaturally bright and airy it was odd because the house was not like that when I was growing up. I forgot to say that before I left Sibel's house she came home from her trip and she was rushing around and wanted to know where everything was, just to make sure she knew before I left & I had to give her a bag of laundry with the towels in it, big towels that I didn't have time to wash, which I felt bad about, because I knew she would have extra work to wash the laundry-but this is the kind of person Sibel is, very efficient and not humbled by doing mundane things though she is an eminent scholar of architectural history-- I hated being in Fresno, it was awful I didn't want stay there, was horrified thinking I could not get out, & I wanted to go back to Boston; my mom seemed worried.",,
17035S,"I was staying at my old house with my family and some friends. We were running around, playing in the river, and building forts. Then we hear atvs in the distance and far away we could just make out a big group racing toward us down the dirt road. Everything about them screamed hunters/fisherman and we just knew they'd be loud and leave trash everywhere. Plus we were worried about our group of dogs because we just let them run wild. They finally reached us and at least had the decency to slow down so we weren't all engulfed in dust. They didn't really introduce themselves but told us they were staying in the house next door until the caught what they were after. Next door was a few minutes walk away but that still seemed too close. The next thing I know my group is outside lounging on the porch when we here a shot. It was like an earthquake in my ears. The dirt road has disappeared and now it's one long porch that stretches along the river. I pull out my binoculars and I can make out the ""neighbors"" aiming their guns at us. I was confused until I saw a huge fish jump out of river right by my face. I hear another shot and I'm blown backwards. My family and friends ran away at the first shot, so I was left alone. I look down at my foot and there's a hole in my ankle. There's blood pooling all around me. I try to wash it away, but it doesn't work. My family comes back and they start yelling at the fishermen who were also on their way to us. Each man was covered with the large fish they had caught. My mom tells them they injured me and need to bandage my ankle, but the leader refuses to admit I was shot. He won't look at me. Meanwhile my ankle is still bleeding and I know it should hurt but it doesn't and for some reason I can't stop acting like it hurts even though I don't feel any pain. People start arguing and then the helicopters come. The Division of Game and Wildlife call out to the fishermen through loudspeakers from the helicopters. All hell breaks loose. My friends and family run for cover. I can't run but I tell my family to run and they do. There's gunfire everywhere. I make it to the shelter where the fishermen are taking cover and it's a little shack that doesn't seem like it'll last long. I ask when the division of wildlife had become so fierce and gun happy, but none of them hear me. My ankle is still bleeding. One of the younger guys starts wrapping my injury up to stop the bleeding and I call him out on how they told my family they didn't have any first aid to help me. He doesn't acknowledge this and I get so mad I pass out. The lead fisherman gets a call and tells the rest of his group that there's an escape crew ready to get them out. Sure enough a bunch of snowmobiles show up behind the shack under cover of the trees. The helicopters can't reach them. The guy who wrapped my ankle carries me with them and even though I'm supposedly passed out I'm angry about it. The fishermen make their escape to their boat and soon they're in the middle of the ocean. I get gently put on a couch and my ankle gets rewrapped and treated with fish scales which somehow work to stop infection and regrow the skin around the gaping hole.

We were in a church that wasn't a church and for some reason they all had to stay there during confirmation. One of them said that they thought the stack of Bibles they needed was in one place, I said it was in another, and I felt a bit smug as I was proved right. There was a litter of puppies (old enough to be a few months past being weaned) where one puppy needed to be assigned to each confirmand, yet for some reason they all stayed in the covered box and weren't given to them yet. I also was working for my old manager and was balancing both my regular work (with a more flexible schedule and fewer hours than I have IRL) and teaching the class. The second day I realized that the puppies hadn't been fed or watered and I was so scared that they would be dead, but I pulled back the blanket and they were alive. I filled one bowel with water for them and another with some food; eventually I added some leftover pasta soup to the food bowl once it was emptied. One of the leftovers I'd set aside for the dogs, wrapped in tinfoil) was rotted - I looked inside the foil briefly and it looked like a decaying, dead bird. I didn't tell anyone about how I could have accidentally killed the puppies through starvation/dehydration, but did assign one to each confirmand. I was a witch like one put of Harry Potter, I was with two of my confirmand friends and we were walking through the busy streets that were in France but not really France and one parade was streaming up one direction and another was streaming down the other direction, and we had to walk through both groups (this felt dangerous for unclear reasons, maybe the groups would attack if we interfered with their movements?) because on the other side of the road was a p√¢tisserie that I think ai needed to go to to be able to feed the puppies again. We made it across the street and into the packed store - we went through the first room into the second, and made it to the back of the line which somehow also the place where you ordered. I wanted to take a picture of the pastries in the case but wasn't able to, even when I tried from a few angles (this was likely inspired by my phone dying without warning when I went on a walk yesterday was taking pictures, the phone was at 61% battery). It was my turn to order, and one of the confirmand's suddenly had her puppy with her but it was now a full-size dog. I tried ordering in French but the woman in the store didn't understand, she tried to offer me (in not-at-all-French-accented broken English) a large, dark, braided pecan role instead of the small choux pastry with green craquelin (the craquelin wasn't on the pastry yet, even though the Great British Bake Off has taught me that it needs to be placed on top of the dough before its baked). I was sad not to get what I wanted, but the alternative pastry looked ok, so I agreed. I was them the only person near the p√¢tisserie clerk and she told me something about the Minister of Magic and I had to go on a mission. I walked down a ramp of the store and started talking to a blond British man/wizard who listened to the equivalent of the wizarding BBC radio to be briefed. The minister wasn't listening to briefings though they were available, and was possibly a dark wizard (no doubt this was inspired by Donald Trump) I looked into the large glass window and climbed through it. The blond man and I ended up in one place and we were hoping that with another quick apparition to a third location that we could go back to the first place, but we had to trap something in a sort of expanding purple sleeping bag that could fully zip up. The creature kept expanding and we weren't sure we'd be able to finish closing it in time, but the creature's presence let us know that we were compromised and would need to apparate to more places to hide our tracks before we could return.",,

I said do you think I should go first since I designed it? But Emily and someone else said no. We got to the front of the line and she walked into an empty room, crossed at a diagonal to the middle, posed, and then left at the exit across the room. I walked into the room and as I walked in I heard a small voice directing me. I noticed that there was a sheet of paper taped to the wall where Emily had stopped and I was directed there. I was told to lean back and pose. Then I left by the same door as Emily and the voice drifted away. For a second I thought maybe I was supposed to follow it, but thought I did the right thing. Outside the door there was an entrace to a small auditorium and I went in. There were people scattered throughout the seats but I didn't see Emily. I saw Stephanie and Fritz and kept looking but no Emily. I thought where could she have gone? I sat between Fritz and Stephanie but they were each occupied with the person next to them and didn't speak to me. I wondered if Fritz would remember me from high school. I sat for a while and then got up and decided to look for Emily. I left the auditorium and walked around and saw other rooms but couldn't find her. Then I walked back to the auditorium and looked into the glass panel in the door and saw a group of people all in bright red. Josh F. from elementary school was there.

220L,"I was visiting a nursing home in an apartment, I may have seen an elder family member, maybe yes, maybe no, and then the apartment converted into a dorm and I was cleaning up stuff in my dorm with great urgency. I think there were little paper packets, almost like little packages of salt you would get from a dinner that I was picking up from tables and from the bathroom. Suddenly, a young woman, presumably of Asian descent but probably just with dark hair, entered the dorm suite and told me she was a 3L law school student and implied she lived here before and that she may have things in this dorm suite too. Anyway, there may have been other people in the dorm suite, but all of a sudden, I was with my senior year direct roommate and I almost bumped into him - he is very tall and has long, gangly legs. He then drove me in a somewhat nice car to a donut stand by the road and this woman who I recognize from a restaurant in my hometown had multiple tall silver carts of trays of donuts that I recognize from a donut place I go to on occasion, and she said something like they can't sell stuff or something disappointing like that. Then my direct roommate drove me to what I thought was a nice place but it was just Dunkin' Donuts attached to a farm stand. I saw some young men traveling on foot in a group and interacted with them briefly, and then the dream was over.   I am sorry this is so much detail but I went to bed so late and this is one of the strangest dreams I've ever had.",,
7339S,I was visiting a university friend's home. On getting there I discovered an old family friend was working as their cleaner. His regular job is a priest but in the dream he was working as a cleaner as he could no longer give sermons due to covid.,,

1988L,"I was visiting an older couple, they were living in my old grandparents apartment on Louvain, it even smelled like their place and all the furniture was still there - I was moved. Later I was skyping with my family (on my dad's side) for Easter - they were all in that apartment, in the stairs outside. I was skyping from home, with my cousin I think. Then during the call, something went wrong, someone fell, there was blood, then 2 strangers ran out of the case, more hits and screams were heard. Then it was a series of shot where that guy had a small baseball hat and was hitting people in the street, the parks, even a dad with his baby in his hand. Terrifying views.  Later I'm travelling with my cousin - there's a little bit when we're shopping clothes in a giant mall, the same that I sometimes see in my dreams. She bought leather pants, short ones, for her show.  We are later in a countryside house. It's the house of the guy who hit our family. I see him kiss goodnight to his son, who asks if he can play hockey the next day, the answer seems to be no and the kid smiles and says something about having grey lips anyway. It's true that his lips are anormally big and grey. He has a second son too. I don't see him as a violent person but as a dad now I guess. We have to leave because Kev and I promessed to take care of something in the street in front of my parents place, like shovelling snow around a tube in the street. Back with my cousin, the guy told us he can lift us. We say ok. It's a huge car, very high, like a small truck. I go in the back, we're excited because it's just like hitchhiking in the old days.",,
12790S,"I was visiting family in Iceland.  We were enjoying the last of the snow and swapping books, then a friend who was with me ended up collapsing in the living room and vomiting transparent bile and we couldn't wake him up.  He was coated in sweat and someone said that it was the new swine flu. We were attempting to load him into a snowmobile to get him to the hospital.  When i was rubbing his back, my mother yelled that I was exposing myself to his germs. ",,

1313S,"I was visiting San Francisco and someone had recommended a boat ride around the bay. Onboard I was overhearing all these people talking about cruises they had been on (one had sailed there from Moscow). That's when I realized the big mistake I'd made being in this boat, but it had already pulled out of port. Then the dream flashed forward to being in gym class with a friend from HS (in real life I'm 31) and we both had reason to fear exposure so they gave us different clothes to wear while ours were washed and had us do an art project together instead of play with the other kids. At the end, I saw someone I used to work with struggling to sit up on a workout bench so I went to him and offered my hand, and reminded him slightly too late that ""I might have Coronavirus."" ",,

25988S,"I was visiting the United States with Steve and someone else. I think we were visiting a friend and maybe helping them move. We were standing in the driveway talking to them. Then we left and were walking through a town. I realized that everyone was vaccinated except us. We passed a row of stores and one of us pointed out that the branches overhead spelled ""TARZAN."" Then I realized it was the name of the restaurant and it was designed that way. We went to an event with Stephanie at Wesleyan and we put our masks on. I was self-conscious because we were the only ones with masks. Later I said that I was worried about coming to the states because I didn't know if Canada would let me back in; but since we were here now, I wonder if I should get the vaccine -- though I would have to get the second shot at some point, probably back in Canada. I worried about the border turning me away but tried not to think about it. ",,
3711L,"I was visiting Toronto with my daughter as babysitter to the grandchildren, and someone stole all my luggage. I couldn't contact my daughter for help because I didn't know her phone number (programmed into my lost phone), and couldn't go anywhere for help without the cash and ID in my missing wallet. Much anxiety ensued.  ",,

We walked downhill to her husband's work, then realized he had a Half hour yet, so she was going for the neighbor kids. It was 5 and I had to get back to school for supper. I had no $ so had to walk uphill to get to school. Almost got lost, climbed steps,but got there only 30 min late. Then I couldn't find my dorm among all because My room faced back. After walking around and asking 2upperclasswomen, I got in the correct building but I was still having trouble with retracing my way to my room #215. Finally I found it but had to go to work at the ER.  I got there late but ahead of another nurse. She wanted to work but I was first.  She wouldn't back off so I suggested a compromise:  Each would work 4 hrs. today & next Tuesday. She refused. I went to work. She ....?",,
1270S,"I was waiting for my bus at school or something and two trees outside we're catching on fire. Volunteers climbed the trees and batted out the fires, getting burnt in the meantime. Then more trees started catching on fire and the same people climbed up to bat them out. They were totally red and covered in welts and I couldn't understand how they were still climbing trees. One of them fell and sliced his entire stomach open.  When he came down he and I sat on the grass and talked, and he refused to call 911 to tell them he was dying. Later in my dream I dreamt about fire again. I was watching a parachuter land, but he crashed into something and caught on fire before shooting off into the sky again in flames. ",,

20776S,"I was waiting for someone because I needed someone to come and help solve a problem. I looked out and saw a car pull up. My daughter's friend from high school, Orianne, got out of the car but she kind of slid out and was lying on her side on the pavement, half still in the car, looking at me, talking and smiling. She has long blonde hair and was wearing a nice blue dress and jewelry. I wondered if she would get up and as I looked at her face I thought about how long I had known her (since when the girls were in 2nd grade) and how I used to be good friends with her mother.",,

I closed my eyes and when it finally came, I realized someone had grabbed my hand and was trying to help me on the train because she thought I was blind.     Second dream: someone was playing one of the Vivaldi violin concertos popular among skillful young students. The unseen person played very well but the sound quality was terrible. I was explaining to someone else that this had to be a small child using a 1/4 size violin, because the little instruments always sound like a Kleenex box with strings. [True.] The door opened, and a 6-year-old walked out with a tiny instrument. ",,
21079S,I was waiting in a cafeteria while my wife was in a meeting. I started talking with two younger men about  my work experiences in the food processing industry and how inexpensive much of our food we eat relative to the work that goes into it especially for animal protein. When I met my wife after her meeting I commented that I had spent my time being a chatty old man which is not usual for me as I tend to be rather introverted.,,
21387L,"I was waiting in line to enter a theater before the doors had opened and there was a group ahead of me that was together. About 10 or 15 people. Someone suggested that we play the telephone game where you tell a secret to the first person and they pass it down the line from person to person secretly until you get to the last person and then see how much the message has changed. The group said they did this all the time and were very good at getting the right message through. I proposed starting the message and started to tell the first person my message and they said, oh no that's not the message. We always use this one. It turned out that they were so good at the game because they had a fixed message that they always used and had all memorized. I was a bit dumbfounded and felt like some people just don't want to hear new messages.",,

46LA,"I was walking along a road with someone. A car stopped and the person rolled down the window to say that someone's dog was missing.  As I was walking further along I saw a dog.  I looked on its tag and saw phone numbers. I tried calling one of the numbers with my cell phone but the numbers were hard to read.  I had a dream that I was in high school and there were two days left of my senior year. I had to finish the term paper I started for history, but couldn't find the 3 pages I'd already written.  I had to submit about 12 paintings for the art final project but needed a few more, so I started painting some pictures which weren't very good but would just meet the required number.  There was a project due for another subject that I hadn't started.  But I realized that I had already graduated high school long ago, and I was just repeating it, but it didn't matter whether I passed or not because I had already graduated long ago. ",,

20964S,"I was walking down a hallway with a group of people. They were doing an inspection or tour or something. We passed a room where something traumatic had happened for me and another woman on our tour and she went in as the rest of the group went ahead. She came back out and I touched her arm and said are you okay? I almost didn't go in but I got curious and looked in. The room was tiny, not much room around the bed that was in it. I remembered being in there with a captor or hostage and several other people. I went out and said it's so much smaller than I remember.     Other dream: I was looking at a company's website and saw that I was listed as their lead design researcher. It was a new company I had just interviewed for. I knew that they listed me mostly for show/name, so that they could look more established than they were. I told someone that I didn't know what the company wanted me to do.

22326S,"I was walking from the living room toward the kitchen, and found plant matter all over the floor: a big bundle of stems, and some leaves that looked like swiss chard. I must have dropped it last night when I was crossing the room with dinner ingredients the night before, but how could I have failed to notice? I thought to myself (and this is the only aspect of the dream that was accurate, apart from the general floorplan of the house): ""It looks like I was on a drunken bender, but the only thing I drank last night was a tiny glass of sake!""     In the kitchen, I found all kinds of fish in bags that I had left on the kitchen counter. Some was already starting to stink, but the sealed bags helped. Some of the fish I had gotten out the night before and had apparently forgotten about, but it would already be no good to cook with. Some I had bought a few days ago and forgotten to put in the fridge.     I started trying to figure out which fish I might compost responsibly using the bokashi method. The fish that had been left out longest was probably too far gone, and I didn't even want to open the packages because the smell would be too bad, so regretfully I threw those in the garbage. But the fresher fish I thought might do well in the bokashi bin.     I went to the garage, but I found that my container of bokashi bran had been opened and overturned, and the bran was all over the floor. Then I noticed a hole chewed through the floor right next to the bokashi bin. A raccoon must smelled the bran and found no other way into the garage, so had chewed through the floor to get at it! (In the dream I took for granted that there was another level of the garage below the one on the ground floor.)     It was dark in here, so I tried to turn on the light to better inspect the damage, but the switch wasn't working. I tried the one in the laundry room and that didn't work either. I was getting really worried now, because whatever the raccoon had done had apparently disrupted the electrical system, a potential fire hazard. I hated the fact that I would have to call the property management company, but there was no way to fix this myself.   ",,

I felt weird about it and thought ""don't look again,"" and started walking away faster to avoid him. He caught up with me, though it didn't feel threatening.

9228S,"I was walking on the sidewalk down a residential street when I ran into friends who had just been in a wedding. All the girls were wearing white gowns and looked like brides. The bridesmaids had been told to wear white. We were all on our way to an after-party, and I felt a little bitter that I had not been invited to the wedding. We all walked up to a house and the girl whose house it was was walking with us. It was Cindy from Freaks and Geeks. She asked everyone for money to donate to the party which we all thought was ridiculous. Everyone kind of rolled their eyes. As we walked into the entryway, which was a step down to a lower level to take our shoes off, Cindy got a brown paper lunch bag out to collect money. But we walked past her before she could get it out. She asked us what drinks we would like. She made some fancy bitter drink with brown liquor (maybe whisky?) and really nice ingredients. I decided to go home and left. I was walking up a narrow stepped path that was dirt lined with blocks of wood, like some parts of hiking trails. I was close to the bus stop but turned around when I realized I had forgotten something; and when I returned to that spot I got confused about where the bus stop was. I looked at a Boston subway map. The stop was just ahead of me, and it was a train, not a bus. As I walked up to the platform the train was just leaving. It was an outdoor platform that looked more like the Amtrak station, but then it turned into an indoor station like the red line. I saw Tanor sitting on the bench waiting for the train! I said hi, and there was someone with me now, or someone I knew who got there and sat down too. As they said hi to each other I inched closer to Tanor and slid my arms through his and around his chest and put my head on his shoulder. Is this okay? I asked, and he said yeah! The train arrived and we got on. I asked Tanor where he was going and he said he was going to a sandwich club. I said ""club sandwich!!!!"" like it was a really funny joke and he laughed like he hadn't made that connection before. He was carrying an empty box with him to take his sandwiches home in. Then the three of us were in water and there were docks and boats around us, but we were walking or swimming through as if it were normal or like there was a sidewalk there. Tanor asked what kind of drink we had at the wedding reception and I described the drink to him. He said eugh in disgust, but I said no, it was really nice because she used fancy ingredients. Then I looked behind me and saw people on the deck of a boat at a buffet. There were so many people crowded around and squished together and I panicked about coronavirus spreading. Then I realized maybe I shouldn't have been talking so close to Tanor. Tanor saw that I was panicking and put our foreheads together and said something like breathe or calm down. I did, and thought well, if he's doing this he's probably very low-risk; maybe he lives alone. ",,
14264L,"I was walking outside, it was dark, with some man who was doing some important work and I was commenting on the work and I said, referring to some type of animal we saw while walking, ""he's part of the meshpukha (family group)"" and I said that Yiddish word knowing that I would impress him and I would see if I could make him laugh and he did and I thought ""oh it worked"". For some reason I had to make sure he didn't get angry, the way women know they often need to do with men to keep them from getting angry and violent. He had a kind of balding head, I don't know who he was, I knew if he got angry he'd be violent and when I woke up thinking about this dream I was thinking of the word ""walking"" and I couldn't stop thinking of the songs that had ""walking"" in the title, but thinking about these songs made me very annoyed.

9350S,"I was walking to work/school with my friend Maria (not something I ever do, I drive and Maria and I start at different times), and we stopped in a little restaurant -- which was where the fire station is -- and I wanted to get some breakfast, and I ordered a bagel. Maria did not want anything and she was fretting because we were going to be late. The woman behind the counter handed me the bagel and said ""That will be $3.98"" and I turned around to say something to Maria about how expensive this was, but I did not see her, so I walked outside and started walking up the street next to the park, which is not the way to school. I kept looking around for Maria but could not find her. Then Michele came walking up behind me -- I haven't seen or talked to Michele in a couple of years now -- and when she looked up and saw me and said ""Hi,"" I said ""Let's go back and sit down,"" and we went back to the restaraunt and sat in a booth. I don't recall seeing any booths the first time I was in there, just a few minutes before. We sat, I started to eat my bagel, then for a reason I can't remember, Michele and I stood up and walked outside, and when we came back, after we sat down, I realized there was a family of 5 people already sitting there.  Michele suggested we move to another booth but I told her that since we had already been sitting there and they sat down even though my bagel was right there on the table, we shouldn't have to move. The people sitting next to Michele gave her some toast and lettuce to eat, and the little boy next to me gave me 2 french fries wrapped up in a napkin. We left there a few minutes later and got on a bus. Or maybe a fire engine. Or something in-between. It was open on the sides. I couldn't see where Michele was sitting, and as the vehicle drove onto the highway, I could see that there was a second one in front of us, and I thought maybe that's where she went. Then something happened (can't remember what) but now there was a guy hanging off the side of the vehicle holding a big rifle of some kind, threatening to shoot the drivers -- there were 2 --but there was a guy hanging off the side of the vehicle in front also holding a rifle -- these were possibly assault weapons, or maybe large hoses -- and he started yelling at the guy on our vehicle, taunting him and making fun of him, and the first man swung his rifle toward the second man, threatening to shoot him. We are still on the highway, but the man in front jumps off the vehicle and lands lightly on two feet in the 3rd lane, where a car stops behind him. I'm looking at this, and then I wake up. There was an earlier dream, around 1: 00 a.m. --  that had something to do with shopping for fruit, and again, I woke up from the dream around 1:20",,

I was driving with my family to get back to my apartment and we stopped at a gas station. I stood in the aisles looking for the perfect road trip snack, but I couldn't find it. It felt like hours passed. We were back on the road and eventually I made it to my apartment. Once I opened the door I remembered that one of the tenants was a murderer and it was my job to secretly find them. It was snowing outside. I kept opening my balcony door, walking outside, gauging the weather, and then coming back in. I repeated that a few times. Each time was different despite having just been out. One time I saw two neighbor kids playing. The next time I saw a woman with blonde hair and a man. The man wasn't a tenant. It was so important that they not see me, I panicked and went back inside. When I opened the door again they were gone. The neighbors opened the wall separating our apartments because they needed room for their large family. I agreed and started throwing socks covered in snow at the kids. They thought it was hilarious and less painful than an all snow snowball. The sock snowballs were a hit and even the grandparents joined in. I liked the family. But I couldn't stay in the apartment anymore. Then I woke up. ",,

We escaped form a basement window, there was a lot of snow, it was hard to advance and they could see our traces. They reached us, I start running and hiding, I was in a suburb now, in the summer. I went in the backyard of a house, looking for help. There was a family outside eating dinner on a picnic table. I realized how dirty I was and I didn't want to scare them, but I advance slowly toward them with great gestures, telling them the situation. They were nice, the mother gave me a pamphlet and told me to call there for help, that they dealt with that kind of situation.

Later I spent the night with two friends (one was the same from earlier) who were roommates in this huge house (where neither of them live in real life), a huge place that could've been spooky if not for the presence of friends and the warm, yellow-ish light bulbs. I had packed a lot of things with me (MN just received a stay home order yesterday that's effective Friday), and brought my real-life small terrarium (three small succulents atop a moss, I've had it since last summer, but the succulent closest to the front of the container has increasingly been looking like it's dying vs. just having one or two sections looking like they were dried out, despite me having increased my watering since I've been home more; the moss in real life is more brown than green - my apartment is super dry + though the two succulents at the back of the container have always appeared healthy). My friends were happy to have me stay (move in?) with them, and I think I was still able to go into work. Something happened to the terranium and the moss went from taking yo half of the container to almost the entire thing (not sure if the succulents were still in there) but the moss was now purplish, which my friends and I interpreted as meaning it was all healthy again. We took the terranium with and went swimming with it in the ocean, trying to hold it above the water. My friend accidentally let the terranium go below the surface when she was swimming with the dolphins that had come up to us, and I told the terranium back, but it fell and sank to the bottom. I swam down to the bottom (the water wasn't too deep, likely 8-13ft) to retrieve it. I could see myself swimming underwater to get it,the sun made the greenish-brown water (which was clear and clean, not mucky with seaweed) glow. I think I swam with my eyes open (which I never do because I had contacts from ages 13 to 30 and swam in them). I brought the terranium up towards the surface, it was heavy, and I put it on the dock.",,

We were just south of the turnoff for the pueblo and two in our group were trying to find something from a gift shop run by some people from the Pueblo. I was observing a culture clash; could see what the locals found grating or insulting in the couple's manner and could also see the condescension and deceit (I knew they lied about some silly thing.) coming from the local store people.   We left that place emptyhanded and continued south. We walked through a few places that I made comments about like, ""This is a great breakfast place."" Eventually I was kind of mad that we had not had breakfast.  Then we were in the woods, walking uphill for quite awhile. We stopped somewhere that everyone else went in. I looked around and found a gas station. At this point I realized that it was a worn out car tire was the thing the couple was searching for. So I went over to the gas station and bought an old, discarded tire from them. I went back, showed everyone my purchase. It wasn't exactly what they were looking for but they said it would do.  I was frustrated a little by that, lack of breakfast and the fact that we had a long walk back. But someone in our group led us to a different trail in the woods. It was a wide path that was covered in snow and all downhill but seemed pretty safe to slide down so we did. It skirted the edge of a ski area which was fun to see. The ""ride"" as we slid down was really fun.",,

I wondered why I had purchased something I wouldn't be using for very long. Why did I invest in such a thing when I knew we would be leaving? The divider/screen was made of stainless steel panels that needed to be bolted or screwed together and it was going to be delivered that day. Sophie said she was going to go out for a run with the baby and I was kind of worried about how she would do that with the baby in a baby holder but I told her while she was gone I would just pack my things, get dressed, and if the screen was delivered I would bolt it together.",,

I saw a bat fly up to a girl's head and eat a bug on her hair. She didn't notice. I saw the guy I had kissed with other girls and saw him kiss someone else, then walk away with her. Later I saw him again and ran up to him and kissed him, but he was old and looked like Joe Biden. I got ready to head out to get more of my favorite snack at that moment, ketchup chips. I wondered if I would hate them from eating them too much and associating them with this relationship. I walked to a river and stood over a bridge looking down. I saw two white and soft-looking turtles. I saw more animals too. Two friends came and I said look at the turtles but we couldn't find them. Then I was with Shelby and Hayley in a small room painted white. The room had curved walls and a high ceiling. We took our clothes off to clean the walls. Shelby climbed up a ladder and started hosing the walls down. I saw two condoms stuck to the walls and peeled them off into a trash bag. It was so disgusting.     I was with Cindy sitting across from her at a table. I told her that my bedroom was very small but cozy and cute. I was describing it to her. I said there's a closet on one side, then the bed, then a bookshelf... but I couldn't remember what else was in my room.     Someone (maybe Cindy) told me that a forest in town had been burned down to make room for some kind of development. I said but what about the hammerheads?? There was a nest of pileated woodpeckers in the forest with baby birds that hadn't fledged yet. I knew that they were probably dead. I was so upset. Why couldn't they wait to tear it down until after nesting season?    I was out shopping with my mom. I waited for her outside a store and decided to go into a different store. As I walked in I realized there would be people and I might have to touch things, but the door was propped open and I walked to avoid passing others. I thought I should leave right away but saw jigsaw puzzles and other games and looked at those first. Then I left and went into a kind of atrium, the kind in shopping malls, and saw my mom running ahead of me. I wanted to run and catch up with her but it was hard to run so I just yelled ""mom!"" and she stopped. ",,

A bunch of people were not coming in saying,""it's fine, we're ok.""  We kept urging and pleading with them to come in as the skies were darkening and weather was changing.

I was looking for my dream-boyfriend, who looked like a younger version of my dream-father, and I saw him running across the hall on the other side of a glass door. I waited for him, then we ran together to find a map. All of the rooms in the building were labeled by teachers' names (at this point the building we were in was a school). I figured out a way to where we needed to go, which involved climbing up a vertical cliff edge. I surprised myself by being able to climb it. The texture was a bit soft, like snow, so that I could crush my fingers into the cliff to get up. At the top, someone had to pull me over as I didn't have the strength to get myself over the edge. We found a staircase to the rest of the building and kept going. We found a peculiar staircase with a twisty railing that the building architect had designed for herself, that if you followed to the end led you into a wall. At an intersection in the building, I led the group of us down a hallway that led to a dead-end which was a huge room of storage for Balinese instruments. We turned around and went outside. I was with one girl now. I was stopped by an elderly woman using a walker who walked right next to me and sandwiched me in between two other people. I couldn't move until she passed; and then she yelled at the girl behind me for blocking her path. As we entered a courtyard, I realized how crowded it was. Almost as soon as I had realized this, I realized with dread that no one was practicing social distancing. I pulled the collar of my t-shirt up to my face to cover my nose and tried to avoid everyone's path as I walked.

8279S,"I was with a younger female friend. We were in a situation where there was some kind of negative behavior. I can't recall the middle part but do remember telling her I thought she'd make a great Montessori teacher, because of the way they can handle negative behaviors. And if I had known about Montessori, I would have chosen that as a teaching career, that they provided a way to discipline kids.  2nd dream sequence: walking somewhere, holding the hand of my parents' and our longtime family friend, Frank (deceased). 2 adult family members walking in front of us. I never held his hand in real life. His hand was cool, comfortable, easy. I asked where his wife, Lillian was. He said she had to take care of her mother, who was failing rapidly and had dementia. In a nursing home or hospital setting. I said I understood because I had dealt with my Mom's dementia behaviors up until her death and went into detail about her biting staff, screaming, trying to restrain her. (In real life, Lillian and my Dad died 1st, in their 70's, my Mom and Frank went on trips together, and then Frank died in his early 80's leaving my Mom to survive until she was 90)  The scene then moves to a family place called The Farm, where my Dad grew up and the site of many large family gatherings. My brother had seized control of the place after my Mom's death and we gave it to him after a lengthy court battle. Surprisingly, he had not changed the main 2 locks and we were able to get in. There were at least 2 other adults with me plus my brother's daughters who were teens (now in their 30's). I was basically curious about how the inside had changed and everything looked pretty much like it did when we had last been on the property around 2008. The girls complained they were cold. I was indifferent and annoyed. Suggested that perhaps they had extra clothes there in the drawers. We had some kind of time commitment, so I said we needed to leave.  Analysis: My brother and Trump have much in common in terms of behaviors. My nieces were also difficult as kids and teens. Although I had a brief career as a high school teacher and from the age of 8, my brother's primary caretaker, I was never taught how to handle difficult behavior. After I learned about Montessori when I was in my late 30's, I realized that there were techniques that would have helped, both with my brother and in the classroom. Yesterday we had discussed how Trump's staff must feel, trying to spin his behaviors every day. My nieces were often difficult, sneaky,mand nasty kids as well. I had taken some stern stances with them that ended up in a row with my brother telling me that I was never to correct his kids.I also feel I could have handled my Mom's dementia behaviors better with deflection, distraction techniques, although in reality, I am not sure anything would have worked once she was raging. Frank gifted us with many handmade gifts. He was a talented guy with a quirky sense of humor. I wish I had known him better as an adult, e.g. his background. Not just as someone I had grown up with, another kind, caring, adult with no personal history. So, my mother, my brother, my nieces = Trump and the question of how to deal with these people. My Trumps supporting neighbors pose the same problem for me as they have caused chaos in our community. We have a friend of 50 years who was also a Montessori teacher. We interact on Facebook daily. I think I will discuss methods for dealing with out of control people with her.",,

At one point we were all out big sail boats and we each had our own, a motor boat went by and my boat capsized which didn't make sense because it was much bigger than the motor boat. One of the people from the lab got me out of the water and onto her boat and we continued on and made it to the wedding. At the wedding I didn't know what to wear, I had clothes that made be look like a waitress or business casual quarter-zips. Also most of my clothes were wet.

I kept asking him how he got in. And why you wanted me to pay for it. He just kept talking. As I recall, I was in my underwear. Then other people came and it, young teenage boys I didn't know. I talked to one of them and told them he would like the school district where my kids went to school. Then the dream shifted to me, alone with a man I've never seen before with an earring in both ears and a lot of hair. The mood seemed to be that he was sexy, but I kept thinking he was not my type at all. At the end of the dream, I was walking on moors in England and I noticed a group of men looking up at the sky. I don't know what they were looking at. Then I met a woman in a little village who was looking at some houses, and I talked to her. Then I woke up. (I've always loved England). ",,

And it was just a space with plastic walls hanging and I said ""we should just switch"" because I think I was assigned a really nice bathroom. ",,

A woman in front of us stepped on a duck by accident, and seeing that it was injured, killed it with her hands to put it out of its misery.

My father in law created an escape bunker (very out of character) and we escaped to it. The entrance was behind a functional swinging vending machine.  Unfortunately, he also packed it like a health nut (in character) and we ended up eating quinoa all the time. My toddler was happy. We eventually started a small and in retrospect incompetent resistance movement. The dream at this point became much more video game like. We went on missions to kill the state's dinosaurs and eventually got caught. We narrowly escaped through the vending machine door and for some reason this was enough to fool the enemy and we were safe. ",,

She got up and decided she wasn't sober enough to enter the concert so we were walking away and we saw this car drive by us and a cop immediately pulled out after it with its lights on and it turned into a police chase. Then another car came up and was chased by police also and it was very dangerous to be standing out in the open so this whole crowd of people at the event went and stood under an awning/gas station type thing to get protection from the poles but then the cars started weaving through the poles trying to hit people and as a group we had to maneuver out of the way using the poles as protection. ,,
1756L,"I was with my friend Chris. He sent me a text message as we were standing together, which I received in the form of a handwritten note in a notebook.

I told my husband to apologize.  Second dream.  I was at work with a friend who volunteers there.  There was a group of 3 doctors at a table behind us.  My friend and I were looking through the file cabinets for a printed copy of an email that had been sent to a client. My friend pointed out that there had been errors in the email.

On the jeepney, I was sharing that I felt relieved that classes would in med school would resume by September. This would give ample time to finish my remaining subjects in msk, derma, and psych before june 15, take the PhD comprehensive exam, and finish renal and write a review paper. They commented that though I look a little tired, I also look happy.    The dream shifted into a different one. Again I was with some of my MD-PhD colleagues and Carl, my closest friend from uni, who's a year ahead of me in med school. We were riding a small car when we chanced upon my English teacher in uni. We introduced ourselves, and found out the one of my colleagues had her as his English teacher.    We found ourselves inside a film theater. She asked about the possibility of making ad videos on political issues to be played on cinemas. She lamented that their departments posts on the current politics issues in our country have only reached a few people. We said that making a video might be expensive because it has a ""higher price per pixel"".    The dream shifted. I seem to be in Manila now because of the MRT/LRT trains. Carl and I got into a discussion about meeting our uni professors after uni. We had to part ways since he was going to a different place.",,

I was comparing where I had previously been in Miami.    In a separate dream, I was driving on a rainy night up a large hill. Then I was basically rock climbing up that hill looking for shelter from the rain. I was working my way towards what I thought was a church, and another person was climbing up this huge pile of rocks with me. Then the pile of rocks led into the attic of someone's house (we climbed through the floor) and they pointed us toward the church but I was a little embarrassed to wind up in someone's house.",,

She had about a dozen or so bags of frozen breast milk.  We talked about donating them.  The second dream was in a large, contemporary house built on a sloped setting. A friend I had known years ago was there and she owned the house.  People were coming over for dinner.  We sat around a large formal dining room table. There were about 10 of us.  My friend made a comment to an elderly relative sitting to her right about her inheritance from her.  The remark seemed rather bold.  Someone was serving dessert to us, something like an apple crisp. I got the first serving was was somewhat small. The next person served got a bigger piece.  I then went down to a lower level to use the bathroom, which was rather large and had a door with an exterior opening. Another guest came into the room from outside.  No one in this dream were wearing masks.  When the man came close to me to talk, I gently pushed him back with my hand to encourage distancing.",,

10879L,"I was with others, family or my husband, I think, looking for seats in a large, multi room restaurant. Spotted 2 chairs without a table. Grabbed the chairs, but someone else said they were holding them. Bright lit, cafeteria sort of setting, formica tables and institutional style chairs, but not fast food.   I was standing, exchanging pleasantries with a man who could have been a professor or coworker of mine. We were both mid 40's +/-. He was leaving and I ruffled his hair on the top of his head as we were saying goodbye. A bizarre thing to do to another adult. He was on a downward slopes ramp out of the restaurant. I am an habitual ""toucher/hugger"" sort of person. I pulled my hand back, shocked at what I had done and said I was sorry I had done that. I was very embarrassed but I did feel great affection for this person and comfortable with him. He laughed and we joked about it. As I woke up I was confused as to whether I shouldn't have touched him because of covid19 or because it would be considered sexual harassment. Of note, wearing masks was not part of the dream.  Limited Self analysis: In my real hospital work life, in my mid 40's, I was older than most of my team. Both the doc and my supervisor were men who were younger than I. I was the team leader (45 people) but often functioned as the  team mother. I had great affection for all of them but haven't seen most in over 20 years. During these last 2 months I have often said and thought that I am glad that I am retired, or I would be in a hospital, working right now. I may have been reminding myself that I no longer had ""a place at the table"" and that I missed that easy comraderie but times had changed. All of the wiping of tears, hand holding and easy arm around the shoulder or hugs I gave would now be out of place.",,

13160L,"I was with Sherlock Holmes and John Watson (I was watching the recent Sherlock BBC series right before bed) with a blonde friend I didn't recognize, as well as a woman who I think was my mother but she was also the housekeeper from Sherlock. Somehow we give had ended up in a scenario that was both real (in that it had actual, permanent consequences if anything bad happened) but also was a simulation (not dissimilar to Upload, another series I recently watched). We had infiltrated this alternative place that was created by someone not-good (don't know whether it was Moriarty or someone (s) else). I was with my friend and the housekeeper/my mom on a grassy hill, on the lower slope that lead down to a lake with dark, unwelcoming-looking water (not far behind us, the slope hot fairly steep). There was a woman either on the air or higher up on the hill telling us, a group of largely women lying recumbent (facing away from the water), that you could become pregnant if you wanted to be, even if you hadn't before. My blonde friend who was and wasn't also me had her stomach swell, and she and Sherlock linked hands and sound around in a circle (which both looked fun and carefree - not very like the character, in that respect - but also was somehow similar to the episode when Sherlock spun Watson around in a circle to try to improve his memory recall). Then a baby popped out of her/my stomach (like something out of Sims, not like in actual childbirth), was there for a moment, and then disappeared. Sherlock thought this was great because he both wanted to see how the baby generating thing worked but also didn't want a baby. His reaction didn't bother the rest of us, as the baby wasn't real. A couple men from the alternative place arrived and were discussing that the entire group should be how going elsewhere, but our small group knew that meant they'd found out about us and we're trying to catch us. The housekeeper was sitting on a step near a building further down the hill with the other women who weren't part of our small group and she seemed tired and/or willing to remain there to give the rest of our small group a chance to get away.  Sherlock, Watson, and I (I think I'd fully needed with my blond friend - IRL I'm a brunette, and in the series Sherlock's love interest, Irene Adler, is also a brunette vs. Watson's wife, who was blonde, but I was neither character, yet somehow also linked with Sherlock) were walking in the shallow water and rocks at the bottom of the hill trying to get into/beyond a small patch of trees to avoid detection (I don't recall feeling like my feet/legs were wet or cold from standing in the water, though in a similar IRL situation I likely would). Next we were back at our wood cabin with tall ceilings, and Sherlock and Watson were trying to figure out how to get us out of there so we could escape back to reality, because we knew there were people chasing us. The bad guys arrived, I somehow ended up on top of these very (maybe 10-12ft) high up closet, I was crawling on all fours around there, not tons of space between me and the centrally peaked (inverted V) wood paneled ceiling, and the redhead (reminiscent of the AI redheaded bellboy in Upload) stretched and was facing me menacingly from one side of the wooden closet, and so I tried to crawl away from him.",,
20284L,"I was with Sho (my son) and he got a fax and it was a letter from the job interview he just had & he looked up and looked at the letter then looked upset and then crumpled up the letter and shoved it in his pocket and I said oh no what happened is it is it a rejection letter? and then he handed me the letter or rather other parts of the letter that he hadn't put in his pocket and it was page after page after page of this old-fashioned kind of computer print-out paper but it was a long letter explaining everything about the hospital where Sho had interviewed and it was talking all about different processes and all kinds of details and pictures and diagrams and explanations and I was looking at it and I thought how is this a rejection letter? and then I looked over at Sho and  he said to me ""I got it!"" and I said what do you mean I thought you just crumpled up a rejection letter and he said well I don't know if I got the job or not, I can't tell and I said gosh I don't know it's so confusing because it seems like you got it, if they are telling you all these details but what does the other letter say, the one you crumpled up and put it in your pocket? and he started to take it out of his pocket and smooth it out so I could read it and then suddenly we were all going to lunch, Nancy (my sister), me, and someone else, and Brian Bobbitt from the local political activism group here was there and he was going to drive everyone to this new restaurant and we were in a little area of a town that had a lot of small shops and one of the shops was Brian's and it was like a cookie shop or something, and the roads though were all dirt roads and up I was anxious about Sho's job letter but we had to get going because Brian was ready to leave and he was driving us and there was a new restaurant I was thinking about and I said or I wanted to say I hope we're going to this restaurant but I didn't know if Brian had known about it or if it was OK for me to mention it but I kept thinking about this restaurant, the kind of food they serve, and I was getting really hungry and thinking about food but on the way out I grabbed a cookie from Brian's shelf and I went back and grabbed a paper towel to wrap the cookie in and I was worried I was holding up the drive to the restaurant plus I was wondering if Sho had gotten a job offer and just didn't understand the letter correctly or something, then I think I woke up at that point.",,
11193L,"I was with some friends (that IRL e video chatted with last night)  and we had hiked up this steep incline to this area where there were a few trees, but mostly pale burnt sienna dirt and great views (we might have been in hills/very low mountains?). We had volunteered to be extras in a theatrical production at our old high school so I went back home to change first - it took under half an hour to get back to my parents' house (IRL there are no mountains or climbing areas near their house). My brother was home (IRL he lives in Germany and hasn't been home since New Year's) but we didn't chat much. I tried on some different work out attire, most of which I don't own IRL, but some of the sports bras looked like ones I'd looked at buying online IRL. I was cognizant that I was supposed to have changed quickly and then returned to my friends so we could go to get school together, but I dawdled there trying on different outfits for over an hour. I rejoined my friends (but don't recall having to drive or hike there, it was like I teleported), and we prepared to grab our packs and go to the school.  The scene changed and I was walking with my mom and a few others down a wide dirt trail but on either side their were houses (spaced like suburban houses a decent distance far back from the road/trail). Someone called out to my mom and she couldn't quite hear what they'd said. I took her arm as we walked and said that they'd said something about my cousin/my cousin's kids and she should just wave back (IRL it's been more than 10 weeks since I've been within 6ft of my mom, though I've seen her in person a about 6 times).",,

I looked out the window and saw people walking into the forest. There was a path that was dark and above it there was a walkway that was more popular. I decided to go to the secluded path.

The plan fell apart and then I realized I shouldn't have been involved anyway since it was similar to treason. I went back to where I was- similar to a retreat center. There were women there I went to private school with that I hadn't seen since I was 12. They were snobby and ostracized me like they did back then and I realized I was still an outsider. I wandered around the grounds by myself thinking I am still/always alone. ,,

Walt Disney, who was Walt Disney's brother, had bought the place and was instituting new procedures focusing on automation because he was also Henry Ford. Walt was in his 70s, but had died a few decades earlier, shortly after his brother, Walt Disney. As a member of the clinic staff, I walked to his memorial museum by airplane with him.

The general disposition looked like a computer science lab, tables with computers at even distances, three row of tables with four lines of computers.   The desk was really a long table along a wall, and I had a desk neighbor close that I did not feel I knew. We were about 7-10 people in my row.  The room was well lit, it looked like natural lighting but I did not notice any window, though I felt like the lighting indicated that my own position was along a wall of windows.  My desk space was not very large, about the width of two computer screens, and there were a lot of open, academic books on my space and some paper. I did not notice anything specific on my computer screen, it seems that my work was mostly on paper.  A supervisor(someone I felt I knew, like a mentor slightly older than me) stopped to talk to me and we argued about the subject of my work, some statistics on COVID-19. The tone was friendly.

10860L,"I was working outside my medical field for a very kind family, who owned their own business of some sort in an expensive area of Seattle a few months after viral restrictions were lifted.  I wanted them to explore a smaller office building; because I could see the effects of the pandemic would loom even larger once people failed to pay their ""forgiven"" rents next April.  Not only would less expensive space already or soon be available; but they would not be burdened with this very large office for only a few employees.  Yet they were a conservative family ,full of belief they were the ones slated to become billionaires at the downturn.    Whatever they produced, I could not view it as profitable once a large swath of the population lost its money.  Thus I would tread the fine line of caring without being nosy.  After all, it wasn't my business.    At the end of the day, all unrelated employees had to note where the underage family members were located on the property when we left.  That day, I also was handed a letter on blue stationery from one family member.  It announced where everyone was situated; so I photographed it, submitted it by email, returned the letter, then left the office.  Immediately, I realized the photographs would stay on my personal phone and the family would not be happy; but I already had clocked out and I could deal with it later.  At the time, I thought I would save them money by not needing to check and note everyone.  I knew I never would misuse the photos of the letter; so I made a mental note to show the daughter I am erasing them in front of her tomorrow.   Outside the terrace-like cement building was a beautiful wide canal, with medium-tall palm trees blowing in the wind.  Between the office and the water were cascading steps, which could be used as seats for people on picnics or actual bench seating for concerts.  On this day, the US military had gathered to celebrate something.  By some unknown entity, I was given the task of listening to them; so I had to pose as a park employee.  To the side of this big stairlike formation, I noticed my estranged husband had brought my once best friend to parade her in public.  I could hear her telling a group I knew that she had ""big news"".  I immediately surmised she was announcing their engagement, although he and I still were not divorced.  However, she had called everyone together to announce she realized, ""I am a dreamer!""  I was walking past at that moment, and, without stopping, I had to ask, ""Don't you mean schemer, demeaner, feeder? Not a dreamer...""  Then I continued walking.  ",,

We went to a nearby elementary school (in real life, I volunteered at a nearby elementary school that closed for at least a few weeks due to COVID-19; also three of my cousins are teachers and the decision was made within the past 24 hours that their districts l will not re-open this school year) where we got the info but didn't end up bringing a chair (that looked just like my kitchen chairs, my real life work from home area is set up at my kitchen table) back with us. When we got back, we were at my kitchen table / work from he station but not really there and something about different makeup face/eyeshadow brushes, some of which looked like they'd been used in something reddish-orange (in a shade I used to have in a lip tint), some in more of a mauve.

I was with my brother's ex-girlfriend (circa 2002, I am still friends with her in real life) and the mall was super fancy and only obnoxious wealthy people were there, and no one was wearing masks. The was a restaurant with plush red velvet booths. My friend went to get waxed at a beauty salon (overdue since the shutdown), but I felt embarrassed going to such a rich snobbish one so I just waited awkwardly outside.  I had another dream I can't remember now.  Then at the end of the night I had a dream that I was at a  friend's house - I think there was a get together (not a party per se), but suddenly my friend handed me a lapel mic and introduced me as the next speaker to a meeting of the UN via a telecon. I was super stressed about being put on the spot to speak (I hate public speaking in real life, but I do a lot of it for my work). I was supposed to talk about autonomous technology in space, but I didn't know anything about that, so I just said what I did at work and tried to tie in related autonomous work in our division. At the end of my speech, the crowd (which was a bunch of ~20-30yos) cheered loudly and it turned out I knew someone in the audience who was yelling my name and referring to an in-joke as a way of identifying themselves. That felt good. Then I laughed and everyone who didn't know who I was could suddenly identify me from my laugh. (This happened in real life once). The end.",,

8179S,"I went back to study abroad in Copenhagen, only I chose the coldest and darkest months to study. No sunny and warm days. I wasn't prepared to study either, my mom and boyfriend drove me to the airport to catch my flight and I only just made it on. I told them to wait at the gate and once I found my seat I'd come back to say goodbye. As soon as I found my seat the plane took off and I couldn't say goodbye. I hoped they'd understand, but I was the one really struggling with not saying goodbye. My brother was a flight attendant and when his shift was over he came and sat next to me on the flight and I felt much better. He asked how I got on the flight without my drivers license and I pulled out my passport. It was basically wrecked and the outside of the passport was sopping wet. My brother said I was an idiot for getting it wet but that the document was still useable for my trip home. I arrived in Copenhagen at a hotel that felt very 70's. It overlooked a church. I unpacked and started to feel excited, so I took a bus tour. It looked nothing like the city I remembered. I met with my adopted aunt and she took me around a farmers market. The food looked delicious! But I remembered that I didn't have money, so it was hard to walk around a whole bunch of food and not eat. I get a text from my old ballet instructor and she's with a girl from ballet because the girl's boyfriend is studying abroad in Copenhagen too. I meet them next and we pitter patter around town buying dorm essentials for the boy. He's about as cowboy as you can get. I get a text from my parents and they're in town too! So I tell the others I'll catch up and run to meet my parents. We do some touring before catching up to the others. We stop at a church on our way and it's a mechanical wonder with intricate pieces of wood depicting st. Francis and animals that move when you donate coins. Kind of like a slot machine. I'm happy that St. Francis got such a beautiful shrine. We meet back up with the others in a dime store. It has a bunch of shirts and socks and laundry detergent, but otherwise it's pretty unremarkable and overpriced. The employee working seems overworked. I ask him for water and he gives me a mug. For some reason I can't leave the store. It's been almost an hour and I still can't leave. My parents say they'll wait outside, and the rest of the group is long gone. I decide that it's the mug of water holding me back, so I go to return it and the employee opens a back door for me to follow. Following a stranger into a suspicious area seems dangerous but it's my only hope of escaping for some reason. We walk through a lot of narrow doors and halls and finally reach an employee bathroom where I put the mug in a sink. The employee moves to trap me but I side step him. I can feel his breath on my neck and it makes me want to scream. I run out of the hallways and through the doors and he doesn't seem to be following. I finally reach the store and I can finally open the damn door and I meet my parents who seem unhappy with being made to wait. I don't tell them what happened. We move on through the city. We reach a fun store full of bees and honey....and then I wake up. ",,

I got to the meeting area, a grassy field, and saw Stephanie's dad playing frisbee with her brother David but Stephanie was not there. I walked around and saw Laetitia from high school. She looked older and had big eye makeup on. I said, ""Hi Laetitia,"" but she didn't say anything. I said, ""I guess she doesn't remember me."" Then I was up early to get the recycling out, but it was full of food and everything was in the wrong place. I got mad at my roommates for throwing everything in the recycling. I was at a hotel looking at a pink pillowcase on the bed that had an eye makeup smudge on it. The cleaning crew walked through and one of them was the Dude from that movie (the big lebowski? -- never seen it). I was with my mom and her friend and I said ""I'm rethinking being up this early,"" then I woke up. ",,

It's antlers fell off. Myself and someone else restrained it. We started playing 80s ballads and the deer relaxed and bobbed it's head along to the song. My friends went to call animal control. The deer fell asleep. My friends took their sweet time. I got angry when I saw them finally come back sipping on sodas. They told me to relax and that animal control was coming. I woke up. ,,

I sat down next a guy from grad school who doesn't like me very much, and he inched away visibly from me, and I turned to my husband and told him he always does that. Then I went to another gathering at a pub in my childhood hometown where some friends from a club I was in in college were having drinks. Afterwards I left to go get dinner with a highschool friend.

I swung it down by my side but then I thought the kitten would be uncomfortable so I held it level in front of me. A person biking past us slowed down and asked if it was safe to bike on this road to Jamaica Plain. I said oh yeah, I've biked this road lots of times. There's just one section where you'll have to be careful of cars where you merge from the bike lane and cross a road. The person on the bike said something like ok thanks and biked away, but then said I don't feel so good and biked into a driveway. As they biked away I noticed that their skin was completely yellow. I heard them throw up in the driveway. I said to my mom I think they're really sick, and she said they'll be okay so we kept walking. ",,

I didn't wear one either because I was embarrassed to. All of my friends were dressed in regular clothes, but I was wearing a shiny bubblegum-pink lace dress with puffy sleeves... looked like something my older sister would have worn in the late 1980s. I felt like this wasn't the right thing to wear and it only made me more self-conscious. But I stuck it out. When the concert was over, we went through some tunnels underneath an apartment building and found a big box of Doritos. I felt better after I ate some Doritos.",,

I went there with my ex-wife (for some reason, who I have absolutely no contact with in waking life) and she disregarded the rules and started touching all the books anyway.  ",,
6844L,"I went to a woman's house to see some kittens. She was kind of weird, but I politely ignored it, and the kittens were also a bit odd-looking (short legs?) but adorable. Apparently the cats were sorted into rooms by color. One room contained numerous grey tabbies of different sizes, and I hung out with them for a while. I think grey tabby is the least interesting color of cat, but they had great personalities. [Day residue: Juse before going to sleep I read this article about a kitten with deformed legs: https://www.lovemeow.com/kitten-ears-legs-cuddles-family-2645701059.html]     Then I was going to cook an egg (still in the same room), but when I cracked it open, it didn't look right. The yolk had pale striating lines like an incipient network of blood vessels. I suspected it might have been a fertilized egg that had begun developing, and when I looked for the embryo, it was already about an inch long. To my surprise, the embryo was clearly not that of a chicken, but another kitten. In place of a chicken's scaly legs were a kitten's furry ones, terminating in little paws. The embryo moved slightly, so I could see that it was still alive.     How could a kitten be born from an egg? I reminded myself all mammals are born from eggs, albeit usually through an internal process. But surely the eggs of cats are very small, whereas this was a normal-sized chicken egg with a hard shell. It didn't make any sense, but at the moment I was faced with a more practical problem: how was I going to deal with this?     I was the one who had broken the egg and threatened the kitten's chance at life, so I wanted to save it if I could. I recalled a video I saw on Youtube of someone that had apparently brought a chicken embryo to term outside the shell. [Note: This is real, and I watched it a few months ago: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE0uKvUbcfw&t=51s]     Could something similar be done for the kitten? I wrapped up the kitten embryo and what remained of its egg in a small towel and held it to my chest for warmth while googling for instructions. [Day residue: the kitten article also included a photograph of it wrapped in a towel, jokingly labeled a ""purrito.""] The embryo had already grown and become more kitten-like, but its intestines were still exposed. I was sure I had not touched them with my fingers and reminded myself to be very careful about this, because I recognized that contamination was the main threat at this point. I thought things might turn out okay if I kept the kitten wrapped and warm.     On the way home I stopped by a gas station. My tank was still half full, but thought it would be good to fill up while the opportunity presented itself. Because of social distancing, there was a complicated process for buying gas. No one could put gas in their tank directly: instead, they had to purchase a separate container. If you needed a little gas right away, they had small open containers with spouts, resembling watering cans. If you wanted to buy more for later, there were closable containers resembling the tall steel milk cans used by dairies. These came wrapped in plush ivory-colored fake fleece cozies.     I figured it couldn't hurt to have some extra gas in the back of my car for emergencies, so I decided to buy one of the tall canisters - but the lid was optional, and cost $30 more, so I thought I could improvise something cheaper. When I brought the can to the register, I saw a colleague buying the same thing, also without the optional lid. I figured a lot of people wouldn't bother with the lids, at that price. While I was waiting for my colleague to complete his transaction, I grabbed a couple other cute but impractical items. They were impulse purchases that I didn't really need, but I justified them by reflecting that, at this point, anything I bought would be helping the economy.   ",,

She found a pair easily, but I couldn't find a pair in my size, so we decided to drive back home (about 90 miles away) to pick up the pair I had forgotten to bring.  On the way, we picked up a horse that somehow had gotten speared in the side, so we needed to take it to the vet.  We also stopped at an open house because we were trying to kill time and my friend wanted to see it.  When we got to my childhood home, we found lots of pairs of sandals to choose from.  Then my mom came home, and we hid from her in my bedroom and went to sleep.  When we woke up the next morning, we secretly left to drive back to camp, picking up the horse along the way.  When we got back to camp, I was clearly in trouble, but when I explained to the camp director what had happened and cried, she understood it was really difficult and not entirely my fault and didn't punish me.

The pilot came out of a hatch and it turned out to be my college boyfriend. I was absolutely ecstatic to see him. He was running around doing things, I was laying in the grass just blissful waiting for him to come greet me. He did, and I was about to hug him, when he said ""no, I came here because I have something I need to tell you. I think what you said to B was wrong and cruel."" I was surprised, said I hadn't seen her in a long time, and asked what I said to her. He said ""You told her that her gray hair was getting in the way of her new haircut. That was a terrible thing to say."" And he walked away. B was my girlfriend in college and later his wife (true life note: I was dating them both at the same time, consensually on both their parts; but they both broke up with me and started dating each other, eventually were married for 10 years before they divorced). I suddenly remembered that I did see B recently, told her I liked her haircut, and commented on us both having gray hair now. I meant it as a loving thing, like we have both matured and changed and I was touched by this. But I guess it wasn't actually a nice thing to mention to her.    Third dream.

I had my son with me, who is almost 5. While I was talking to the VIP, my son pooped in his pants. I took him to a sink and unraveled a long cloth, for some reason his butt was wrapped like a mummy? It was very messy. Made a huge mess in the bathroom. I saw there was a lot of salsa on the sink in little cups and I took some. Went to a restaurant and saw a man asking a woman to dance, he was very happy when she said yes. Then I noticed B in the restaurant. I apologized to her and she seemed to accept it but was sort of cold.

Happy about the plan, I go pack, and end up leaving with Linda, in a giant car. I'm sitting as a passenger; I can barely see her driving because her seat is so massive. From the car I try to call/skype with my phone, it automatically calls my aunt Claire as well who was clearly sleeping, I say sorry and hang up. Then I receive a phone call/face time from my childhood friend that I haven't seen in years - I don't really want to talk to her now, its too much emotions and I'm in a car with other people, so I try to hang up but then realize that it's an advertisement with her playing in it, some kind of extreme sport in the desert at night, nice production, but not an actual call.

My dad finally helps me, I'm surprise that he can lift a whole car all by himself. I go outside a bit and that's when I realize I forgot about Sayid. He was supposed to take the lift with me, we were suppose to bike together to our camping stuff, and sleep there. It's like I already imagined us doing it, in the rain for some reason, and now realizing it never happened for real and he's still waiting for me. I feel terribly bad. Linda tells me he's in love with someone else anyway, and then I remember the girl from the show and I'm like 'oh, that's right'.

I go up the staircase, then at the last floor, I here some jazz. There's a tiny office space with a jazz band playing, a bass, a saxophone, sweet little morning jazz, it's sunny up here. And behind there's a bigger room, with a coffee stands, some sweet, it smells good, there's a couch, and a bunch of people sitting on tables or in line.

A hug? she said vehemently no no no to each of these suggestions. To go for a walk? She instantly stopped crying a grabbed my hand. Apparently, nobody understood her because she was autistic.

One of them was the child's father, and he asked to get her kid back, so I handed her to him. My friends and I continued to walk around the place. Some sort of altercation was heard and we could see the father claiming that somebody has stolen the little girl. He was crying at his table but doing nothing. Everybody else started to search for the little girl, including me, but I had to stop because I had to go prepare everybody's meal. looking for things to eat, I came back to the warehouse and pass the crying father. I told him he was doing nothing while everyone else was doing useful things but he became hysterical claiming that I was responsible for her child and I was abusing him and that everything was my fault.

I was on a conference call with work at the time, and was trying to negotiate that and the approaching raccoons. (I LOVE raccoons in real life and would have loved to see one in person.) I was afraid of this one, even though it wasn't aggressive, but it wasn't timid and climbed all over me so I freaked out and woke up.",,

16562S,"In my psychology 101 class I was told that when people dream at night, they have different dreams in different REM cycles, but when you wake up your brain combines them all into one story. That is not always the case for me, sometimes I have completely separate dreams that don't have anything to do with one another, and I believe they are from different REM cycles. Las night I had three separate dreams.  Dream 1: I was at my parents' house in San Diego, and I was at the beach. I saw Weird Al Yankovic and his daughter Nina at the beach. The beaches in Los Angeles where they live were closed due to the pandemic, so they were coming to San Diego to enjoy the beach. I hung out with them and became close friends with Weird Al Yankovic, and we bounced on a water trampoline in the ocean. It was awesome.  Dream 2: I was friends with Iron Man, Spider Man, and Happy (Iron Mans' personal assistant). I had the ability to fly and I was immortal. We were fighting an alien invader that was able to shape shift, but the could only shape shift into people who were ugly, or not aesthetically pleasing by the standards of modern western culture. That made things kind of awkward when we saw an ugly person, we couldn't be sure if they were an alien invader, or just an ugly human.  Dream 3: I went to the grocery store and bought some food. That's it, that was a boring dream.",,

When I went to the trash bins with my garbage, I noticed to the west in the distance was a brick-colored, running roller coaster inside an amusement park.  I wondered why I'd never gone on the rides and hoped it would succeed.  Then I looked across the parking lot a few feet and saw a makeshift outdoor theater had been established for Covid restrictions.  Someone seated in the front row needed to clean an overturned popcorn bin and the projectionist stopped the film.  It was daylight and I mused how anyone could see anything, facing west with the setting sun.    Moments later, I visited a patient.  He was sort, bald, and bulky, incarcerated inside an empty store that had been transformed into a cell, complete with a jungle gym of workout gear.  The inmate was very enthusiastic to show me the strength he gained from using this impressive equipment.  It was a bit unnerving; since this was my first moment meeting him.  A female helper then exited the room and left me inside with him and no way for anyone to monitor us inside.  I pretended my job was finished there, and headed to the door, when he ran to place himself between the door & myself.  I could see it was a show of power; but he slowly opened the door for me to exit.  He followed me outside and I was concerned I'd be accused of letting him out of his cell; yet he was able to open the unlocked door.  He continued to walk away, toward those garbage containers to our right, while another theater goer overturned another bin of popcorn and, to our left, the film stopped playing.  Then I awakened.

A student tried out an oximeter on me, but this one needed to put in a needle under my skin.  The computer rooms were a bit dark.

Some parts of the school have been condemned and are not part of the Conjuring. I found my best friend who's also a witch. She's looking for her boyfriend, who apparently has been waiting for her for centuries. The story of her boyfriend waiting for her has become a myth that there was an ""attraction"". In this attraction, people would visit a  fortuneteller/witch to see if there were the one that the boyfriend was looking for. It was a mini cave inside a tree with a water bath. The fortuneteller witch would dunk you into the water bath to tell if you were the one. She dunked my friend and said that her boyfriend is waiting for her.

Then, i had another dream wherein i was still a witch and the forest where I lived was turned into a market of flowers and gardening. I was walking around reminiscing the paths that I used to see as a young witch/nymph. I saw that some witch/wood nymphs still lived in the area. They asked me to help them transport a brown vase. Luckily i had a bag so i hide the vase there. My best friend didn't have one so it was difficult for to conceal the object as it would give away our identity. While going through the market, i quickly found friends from all over the world, there was a girl who is Muslim, a girl from africa, a jewish girl, my best friend, and a girl who was skeptical. The skeptical girl didn't like witches and wanted to hunt them. We were convincing her that witches are a culture that each of us has.

We ended up running over a few people in the street.  When our view was unobstructed again we knew we had run over something.  Then we were in houses right next to each other (looked like tall row houses right up next to each other in bright colors).   Officials came to my door and the two other women to tell us that we had run over people and we were trying to explain that our view was blocked and we couldn't see.  The other dream was at my house but also in the city.  We had a big group of people come stay at our house.  My sister was the only one I recognized.  Their were a lot of guys and high school and college kids. We were all broken into groups and doing activities.  At one point I was in the bed of a pick up truck with a bunch of people.  One was a really tall basketball player.  We were all crammed into the truck.  There was a bunch of clothes from the dry cleaners and we were sitting on top of them and I kept trying to smooth them out so they wouldn't get wrinkled but it was impossible.  I also ended up going to a restaurant type place in the city that this (camp?)group used normally.  I grabbed all the utensils and carried them back to my house to wash.

You're fine.  She told everyone she drives like a grandma.""  Yet I am surrounded by a bunch of Average Joes and I cannot provide my evidence.  In the 1970s, IRL, I went to her house to look at her Dino.

It sits in the 'hood, which means there are immigrants, which means there are actual ingredients for sale and not pre-formed, heat-it-at-home items.    I arrive to Fred Meyer on Evergreen Way and I first notice no lights are on.  It's a dark, stormy day.  I should see lights.  Instead, I glimpse giant yellow taped Xs  across the giant walls and door areas.    Somehow I still manage to make my way inside.  After all, I drive farther for this store than any closer neighborhood spots.    There is no food at all.  Renovation is in progress, using thousands of workers hired around the impoverished surroundings.  No one knows what they are doing and there are signs stating they will open tomorrow.  There is no chance of that happening!  As I try to find a spot in the manager's office area to look at my phone to decide my back-up option, I am told I must leave.  But where is my purse?!?  Someone stole my purse.  Folks just tell me, ""That's why no one is allowed inside the store right now,"" and they are reluctant to help me find it.  In the place of my purse is another purse I normally keep boxed.  It contains all the jewelry I never wear, some damaged yet quite valuable.  I look inside and my Mikimoto pearl necklace remains in there.  At least I have these items, but I am upset I will have to cancel my credit cards, etc. and no one is willing to help me with anything.    I leave the store and make it 90% across the vast parking lot--my car no longer seems to be an actor in this slumber drama--only to experience one worker brazenly shoot his hand into the old black purse and pull out my imperial jade ring, pearl necklaces, along with the ruby & pearl gold ring from the 1700s.  And these only are the items I can see in his large clenched hand. Since I am among the average folks, some of them try to capture him.  I am too unsettled by the melee and awaken.    Dream 3:  This is a quick one and aren't you glad?  Right before I get out of bed, I dream the phone rings and a girl whose voice I hardly recognize tells me I am looking for a job and, ""Hold on.  You are #99, after Lisa.""  I am placed on hold.  I have no idea what job this is and for whom.  I weigh hanging up.  I think I need more information.

I am trying to solve a puzzle that necessitates reading three emails in a particular order, which should be simple enough, but the content of the emails keeps distracting me, which makes me open additional emails, and then I lose my place. [Day Residue: this seems to be a mash-up of trying to wade through the daily onslaught of emails in waking life, together with a puzzle I did last night in Mass Effect: Andromeda that required activitating four terminals in a specific order.]     I (as the young man) am getting so frustrated with the tedium of my job that I am ready to quit. I am walking around outdoors as I make this decision. The environment appears to be a pedestrian mall with shops running along either side, and there are strangely beautiful flowers in large square planters running along the middle. The flowers have huge luminescent grey heads, in a shape that resembles old-fashioned lampshades.     I find that I am determined to solve the email puzzle first, so I decide to go back for one more day. I still can't get it done. Even more determined now, the next day I go in extra early. The building is full of obstacles - large planes with tesselated patterns on them (probably also derived from ME:A) that I have to step over or around. I conclude that this is probably because it is so early that the janitorial staff has not come in yet.     I don't expect to see any colleagues, but run into an old man who has apparently also come in early, and expresses approval. And when I go into the room where I work, I find a whole family living there: a man, a woman, and a small daughter. The woman says that she has picked up her whole education by staying in this room, which is above a classroom. I (starting to revert to my WL identity) realize that I had taught in that very classroom last semester, so I inquire if she overheard my class. She suggests that she did, but when I ask further questions she doesn't seem to know anything about the topic.   ",,

16693S,"In the dream I was female but not WL ""me,"" and not technically human, but a spirit. I was in a forest with others of my kind who also resembled young women, performing a ritual that involved giving food or water to others. The leader, resembling an older woman, called three of us together into a group. She says that although all three of us are named ""Arthur,"" we have very different personalities, and therefore we will be assigned to three very different people. I gather that we are going to be paired with human beings, for whom we will act in the role of guardian spirits. My personality is the most even-tempered of the three. I wonder what that implies about the human to whom I will be assigned.    It begins. I find myself walking with a family. I have inhabited the body of a girl, early to mid-teens, who is accompanying her younger brother and two parents as they walk through the forest. I can tell right away that the boy has a sensitive nature, and he is currently distraught about something. From the way the others are talking, I quickly gather that I am the boy's older sister. I put my arm protectively around his shoulders and offer him supportive words. At first he stiffens against the contact, but then relaxes and appears to be somewhat reassured. I wonder if this is the moment that changes his possibilities. Will he grow up a better person if he feels loved and understood?     Scene change. Years have passed, the boy is older, and now I am experiencing the dream through his eyes. His older sister, the character I had previously inhabited, is about to disappear through a portal to confront some threat. She has long red hair and I notice that she is missing her right eye as she gives him a backward glance before stepping through. Because of her one eye he had given her a bow to use as a weapon, though she also has a long slender dagger with which she is proficient.   ",,

9061L,"In the first dream I was in a bank and three bank robbers rushed in only they were wearing roller skates and they had robbed a different bank, they just wanted to go into this bank to brag about how they stole 4 million. They rushed off pretty quickly but not before I told them that was so stupid to brag at a bank or really take any time away from escaping. Then I was one of the robbers and skating away as fast as I could down the sidewalks of my old college. I had to jump a few times over cracks or roots. I was going super fast and it was exhilarating. The next dream was longer. I was an exchange student at a weird highschool in some Midwest town. The teachers were all from different countries and taught their subjects in their native languages, so I had no idea what was happening. I joined a study group and we all agreed to meet that night in a cabin near the school. I started dating one of the guys and it caused a lot of drama, but I don't know why. We drove around in his car but studied at the same time. I had awesome grades. Somehow there was a super hero element but I don't remember. The next dream was about a family vacation. My family agreed to go on a vacation together, but we all took different modes of transportation. My real life boyfriend and I took a new jeep and we drove through a dessert before reaching a turn off for a mountain pass. We passed a lot of cars camping at the base and wondered why, but as we drove up we started seeing snow and immediately cars started swerving off road. I said something about how ridiculous it was that no one knew how to drive in snow, and then I got scared because I had no idea if my boyfriend knew how to drive in snow. He did great through and I relaxed. Halfway up the mountain we met my brother and his fianc√©. They were in their little car towing a camper. I was super surprised they made it up this far and my brother said there wasn't anything he couldn't do. I was proud of him. We asked why they stopped and they said it would be night soon and they wanted to get their fire going quickly. We stayed with them for awhile, until the fire was lit and we made sure their camper was toasty and safe. Then we drove on. It was dark and we couldn't see anything but snow, but eventually we made it to the coolest town. It was like walking into the Harry Potter World. All the street lights were warm and there were so many cool little shops! My boyfriend and I got our hotel room and started exploring the town. We felt so in love and agreed to go to different stores and meet back up at the pool. I bought a swimsuit and coffee and looked at all the cool trinkets. The swimming pool looked like the river I grew up by, with a fast current and lots of plants by the bank, however it was a pool and the bottom was concrete. It was the strangest pool. My boyfriend jumped in with a pool floatie and was instantly swept away. He was strong though and made his way back to where I was holding on. ",,
19090L,"In the first dream I was seeing things from someone else's perspective. They were surfing and kept wiping out, but it wasn't scary under the water (usually wiping out terrifies me).  Second dream I was me, I think I was an actress and had to do a scene in a confined space and it felt claustrophobic, but I tried to tell myself that I can cut the scene at any time and be safe. But then I started thinking about whether when you die you effectively get trapped in your body in a confined space and that's what it's like for eternity, just claustrophobic terror forever. I had a panic attack in my dream, but when I woke up I wasn't breathing heavily, I just felt the general malaise of waking from a nightmare.",,
4305L,"In the first dream, I was ahem, fooling around with my fiance in the back seat of a car when we saw a family of black bears out the window, trying to get into a house (looked like my childhood home). Suddenly the bears became interested in the car and as they approached, they turned into people. Their was suddenly a baby in a car seat in the car and the bear-turned-person asked if I would roll down the window so they could see the baby. That person started unbuckling the baby from the car set very quickly and was trying to take the baby and i was screaming and hitting the person and telling my fiance to drive....    In the second dream, and the details are very hazy, I just know that I was taking care of my younger brother (who has special needs in real life) and I was very scared that he couldn't be left alone because he is non-verbal and people will not understand him and he will become angry and push people when he is not understood. We were in some kind of waiting room and the dream was very stressful and I seemed to be racing with time.",,

When I was watching the video later though we saw we won $300 in a game but it might've cost a kids life for losing the money. Then I ended up seeing a situation in Russia where Putin decided only 50% of kids were allowed to still live. Each kid had to come up and get a chocolate chip. If the chocolate chip was white, they could live, but if it was a regular brown chip they had to die. It was horrific for the families and we were trying to find all sorts of ways around this. Then after that dream I was traveling in Europe and ended up at this fancy dinner in Germany where my girlfriend became president of something. I got a call and found out I needed to return the $300 from earlier to the singer Greyson Chance who was in a nearby part of Germany. I left the dinner to walk about an hour and a half there. The walk was gorgeous it turned out we were in Switzerland and I could see the alps. I tried swimming in some of the lakes to make shortcuts but the water was too deep and there were lots of cliffs so it was scary. I also got a message from the singer FLETCHER's brother saying that he was running late so I guess he was going too. When I got there it was Greyson Chance along with one of my  friends from college. The house was super fancy but I don't remember what happened after this.",,

25809S,"In the one dream I still recall, I find myself inside the kitchen of my home I recently sold.  I know I don't belong there and am about to leave.  No one is home and I should be able to escape unnoticed.  I realize there is natural gas leaking through a small ""fire fountain"" on the counter Instead of a decorative water fountain, it spouts fire in a vertical way; but now it only spouts gas with a hissing sound.  I determine this situation is dangerous and the home may explode.  In vain, I try everything to stop or lessen the gas leak and I find I must give up, leaving windows open.      I remember I must check whether the alarm is on, although I arrived inside the domicile without incident.  They've changed the alarm from SimpliSafe to ADT and now there is a very large frosted blue indirectly-lit electronic board, must have been 3 feet tall by 2.5 feet wide, on a wall opposing the lesser-used front door.  There is water flowing down it in rivulets.  I look up and notice a leak from the second floor.   With no time to deal with this new problem that is not mine, I gamble the alarm is off; and I leave via the front door.    I walk home to my apartment, climb the 89 stairs, only to find myself back in that kitchen, this time with my mother and a few nondescript neighbors.    Then the new owners arrive.  I quickly explain that I once lived here and I lie I did not want to leave, due to the hazardous gas situation.  She seems unsurprised by our presence.    I look to the barstools at the right of the kitchen island, now brick and no longer granite, wondering how awful it would be to clean it with the grout and rough brick...only to see my two sphynx cats Lars & Wallace curled up sleeping there.  I know they died; but it's such a joyous moment to pet them again.  The owner says, ""I didn't know you had cats here,"" as if she knows they also do not truly exist anymore.    Then she walks to the island.  Other than the brick, it's the most ingenious design.  It's more of a oval Q shape, with an entry point a the Q tail.  This way she can stand in the center, with all sorts of counter & stove & sink space to which she can pivot.   I tell her I should leave and almost grabbed the cats; but I realize they are dead visitors, so I leave them behind.  Then I awakened.",,

I was wearing a Rick & Morty t-shirt (which I have never owned in real life). Luckily they had a spare assistant manager's shirt that I could wear, and apparently that was the role I was in. But there was nothing to do but load the dishwasher so I did that all shift (in real life I spent hours trying to choose a second-hand dishwasher yesterday!). ",,

I was afraid for some reason that we were going to be accused of shoplifting.     In the first dream I remember from the night, I dreamed that my mom had a cabin out in a rural farming area where she was living, my dad had a cabin a little further up the road in the same area, and my sister and I (grown adults in the dream) were there visiting both parents, but currently at Mom's place where she was hosting some sort of social gathering for the evening. I was pregnant in the dream (as I am in waking life), and people at the gathering were generally happy and excited for me about this. Although in the dream, I ""knew"" everyone at the party, they weren't actually people who exist in waking life. But then a family showed up who I was not expecting -- Mrs. Harmon (an actual woman from my actual childhood homeschool community when I was growing up, who I never liked and was generally fearful of as a child because she was forceful and demanding and loud and controlling and would do things like physically shove me out of the way rather than say ""pardon me"" if I was standing where she wanted to walk through, etc. She was physically and psychologically abusive to her her two homeschooled daughters, who were my playmates, which was unfortunately not a very rare situation in our homeschool community.) In the dream, her two daughters, who had been my childhood playmates were with her. They arrived at the party in my dream and I was unhappy to see them. I politely greeted the daughters, (even though we'd had a falling out as young adults in real life and are no longer friends), but I just looked at Mrs. Harmon and kind of sneered and turned away. She grabbed me by the arm and yanked me around to chew me out for being rude, and I drew myself up as tall as possible and told her off, basically, that I'm an adult now and she was always crappy to me as a child and I think she's a terrible person and I have no reason to be polite to her now. She began hitting me and twisting my arm and screaming at me and I said ""really? even while I'm pregnant?"" and pulled out a kitchen knife which randomly had materialized in my hand (?!?!) and I brandished the knife and she went away. Like, not that she walked out the door and left the party, she just sort of vanished from the spot where she stood. Her daughters, my former friends, were upset with me for doing this, and they stormed out of the door away from the party while basically insulting and trash talking me. I left the party and walked up the road to where ""dad's cabin"" was supposed to be, and then I woke up.  ",,

6753L,"It is garbled now because there were at least three phases to the dream. First I was trying to sneak out of my old high school to meet up with my uncle in the parking lot to go shopping I think? But it was mission impossible level tension. I spent a lot of time trying to sneak past a locking door that made you pay for parking. Then that shifted into trying to bypass that gate to pay for access to a swimming pool - it was $18 a pop. While I was trying to work out in the pool, my shitty ex boyfriend from 5 years ago showed up with a hot and way too young new girlfriend and introduced him to his mother poolside. I never saw his face during the dream as I kept turning my back on him. My current boyfriend was there, too, but oblivious to the tension. Then I tried to move to the other pool, but there was an elementary school orchestra on a platform in the pool so they were standing in 6 inches of water. It was supposedly the new fusion extracurricular trend. One clue of why ex showed up is a few days ago I logged into Skype for the first time in years to have an online hangout with friends and my old chat history with my ex was there since we were partly long distance.

Then it morphed into watching a movie or being in the movie(?) of characters trying to escape an old sanitorium and colored poison gas kept pouring in through vents.  Lost in this, I realized my youngest 5 yo was there as a patient in the sanitorium and she explained that she needed an operation to get part of her liver removed. I was furious for my husband for not telljng me earlier, and not getting enough medical details (tumor size, lymph nodes, treatment plan) etc. ",,
9018L,"It started out me and 2 friends who broke out of this house in an almost kidnapping situation and we were trying to rent those bikes like BlueBikes and you needed an app but I didn't have it. But we couldn't find the app because it was under a different name posing as a ""chess game"" and you had to go through these puzzles to show you weren't drunk or you had to be ""smart enough"" I guess to rent these bikes. But we were under a time crunch and I was trying to complete all this stuff to be able to rent the bike and finally we could. We rode our bikes on a main busy road and eventually we ditched them in some grass in a residential area and got tricked into basically getting kidnapped again by a man who runs a psych ward. But it was set up like a voluntary stay hotel where we chose our room and my scuba diving instructor was there with a class trip and she took the biggest room even tho I had put my stuff there already. So I moved to some wack room. Then he put me in charge of going around and checking all the rooms. Then it was time for medicine and it was like a good 8-10 pills and some were specifically for newbies for behavior control and I was getting anxiety thinking about not knowing what they do and they had a little card to tell you a brief description of the pills but you couldn't tell which card went to what. I had taken like 2 before I felt disoriented and another pill was ""immediately paralyzing"" and I wasn't going to continue playing roulette with pills so I was going to behave and go out and ask what each one did. But then the dream changed, kind of skipped to me and a different group breaking out of the asylum and we ended up on a bus the day after New Years and one girl's goal in life (the girl was also simultaneously me and not me) was to celebrate New Years in a restaurant. But that's not what the group did yesterday to celebrate, they went to someone's house but on the bus someone said yeah we should've had it at a restaurant like you wanted it would've been better. And the girl said yeah too late now, bc now she has to wait another year for that. And the last thing I remember was almost like the end of a movie where the ""narrator"" closes the book as if he was reading a story the entire time. And I realized I was reading a really good book so much that I was absorbed into it, and then I woke up. ",,

The DJ kept trying to lure people out, but maybe 20 people would wander out, but then get intimidated because everyone else was still sitting, and go back to the bleachers.  Once we got everyone dancing, Willem Dafoe and Tom Hardy showed up and I knew that they were 1) hitmen and 2) colleagues of my boyfriend.  Perspective shifted and it was no longer our wedding, and there was a small side plot where I had to eject the maid of honor for being just a total jerk to the bride. Then we went in search of the hitmen.  Willem Dafoe killed Tom Hardy, then my boyfriend stumbled across Willem Dafoe's body in a fountain, so we went to their office in order to try to find out who killed him in case they were coming for my boyfriend. Then it became a thriller kind of film where we were bluffing the receptionist, stealing keycards, and hiding from other people in hallways.  I think the imagery was influenced by the movie I Care A Lot. ",,

My boss was there judging me. We ended up going to a carnival, there were so many people there. We were sitting by the water which had alligators in it, we only saw dead ones. I ended up falling in the water because we were playing a game of imaginary catch that I was really committed to.

And there was this scavenger hunt and a lot of people were doing it including me and my ex. On one of the answers, the clue to the next one was hidden and I found the answer. My ex went ahead of me and I didn't know if she had found the clue but I decided we could just do the hunt separate now since she already left me. People were searching for an orthodontist office but the clue told you it was on the 6th floor. Everyone was looking at the floor directory and searching the 3 and 4 floors not realizing there was a 6th. So I run up the stairs and dont take the elevators to the 6th floor. Another girl is with me. When we get to the 6th floor it's as if the building has deteriorated and part of the walls are missing (no wonder people aren't searching this floor) but there's one very nice office still intact. You have to take a short plane ride around the building to get to the right entrance. I walk in the office and my ex is already there and hanging out drinking coffee (she's very smart so of course she found it on her own). We don't speak and I just talk to the orthodontist and sign in. We have to wait until everyone gets to this last part of the hunt so we can have a big breakfast pot luck. We all had brought food to chip in in the beginning.",,

My husband stayed behind as he is likely to do IRL.     I saw an old college flame there with his family. I'm not sure if we coordinated being there at the same time or it was a  coincidence. He and I kept trying to physically connect-- a bunch of furtive kisses and under the boardwalk gropings and some ocean water aereobics  that included a lot more under the water activity than one might expect.

Due to my epilepsy (which I also have in real life) I wanted to teach a class with a duration of 40 minutes. However, I noticed on the class schedule that I was supposed to teach a 90 minute step class. I notified my boss, that I wanted to teach a 40 minute class. The outcome of this ""discussion"" was never solved in the dream. When I was visiting the gym, I met one of my previous colleagues (also a person which is a previous colleague of mine in real life - we worked together at a fitness centre) and we talked for quite a long time. At some point in dream (I don't recall the context), I found myself crawling into a tiny door located at the bottom of a door (somewhat like a ""cat door"").

Anyway, I also hung out with one of my acquaintances/friends/frenemies from college, almost bumped into her head I think, and she, three other people and I sat on the grass or the street of the cul-de-sac in front of my house and talked as I noticed that my neighbor's lawn across the street was reduced and had a distinct curved shape in it, and upon further review, I saw he increased the size of his driveway so it took up most of his lawn.

Once I saw her sneak behind the target to play, but then she got out and stood to the side.  Just then the man shot at the target,scaring her.  That finally taught her I guessed.

I went to the grocery store to buy what I needed and then went home. Then I noticed that I had forgot my wallet at the big table outside the grocery store, so I rushed back by jumping really far and high by using to ""sticks"" of a kind. I went back home, however I forgot something else, but this time i ran as fast as I could to and back from the big table outside the grocery store. When I came back home I waited for my girlfriend to get back but she took forever and didn't responded to my texts either. The dinner got cold as she got home 4-5 hours later than planned.

When it was time to go home I stuck around and saw the people who I thought would give me a ride home, hoped they'd see me looking forlorn and offer me a ride. There were two people in particular who I thought would give me a ride home and I saw they were going to the elevators so I went to the elevators and I got there just too late; I saw one elevator, the doors were glass and I could see the people going down the elevator but they couldn't see me and I couldn't come out and say ""can I get a ride"" -I was just going to try to get in the elevator with them so so they would offer me a ride. I looked at the second glass elevator and it was my friends Jorgensen and Ryan and they would certainly offer me a ride if I got in the elevator with them but the elevator was already going down and I missed them and they weren't even trying to look at me though they could have since the elevator was glass. The office was some kind of design company. Then I realized I am going to be on my own trying to get home so I was outside on a bus or something looking out the window, turning a corner, and I saw the office building. We were in some place like Santa Monica, there were palm trees, and I looked at the building where I worked, saw the roof where I had just been on the roof eating lunch. I ate beef in sandwich, there was lots of brown gravy, and I couldn't believe I had actually eaten meat (I'm a vegetarian). I was on my way somewhere on the bus and I felt a little stupid for not trying to be more bold about asking for a ride. I missed my friends and I didn't know why, or I was sad that they didn't see me and ask if I wanted a ride home. I felt a little lonely but I would never admit it.",,

I was at my parents' house, and was about to rehearse with a collaborative pianist I've worked with since high school. I had no clothes except my black wool coat, so I was trying to make that work as rehearsal attire. When there was a chance, I went to my old bedroom supposedly to grab my schedule, but actually to put on clothes. But for some reason my clothes were all hanging from one of the built-in bookshelves, not in the closet. All I could find in my rush was some kind of medieval costume. I was going to just wear the simple underdress, because it nearly passed as a summer dress, but then I noticed that it was covered in some kind of disgusting yellow stain. So I hastily put on the rest of the costume - bodice, overskirt and a complicated sort of bonnet. By the time I came out, the pianist was leaving. He had put on his winter clothes and also some sort of plague doctor mask. I was aware that both of us were dressed very strangely, while my mother stood there in a sweatshirt and jeans. We confirmed that there would be another rehearsal Thursday at 3pm and possibly also Friday, and he left. I had a conversation with my mother about the strange state of my wardrobe, then woke up.",,

Upstairs in an old building with groups of shops (not a mall), we happened upon a meet & greet with those Tiger KIng people.  I am the last human to not have watched this show, but Karen was agog.  Her voice changed as she met an older man in that family.  Everyone was fawning over his son Joe.  I guess I need to see the stupid show in order to make sense of the dream, but I was shocked & concerned Karen was sublimating herself to this guy, even adopting an American southern accent with him.  Then we walked down some stairs to a main boulevard I had never traipsed, which felt incredible; because I have been to Rome many times and even rented apartments longterm there.  We looked for adjustments for the city after the pandemic.  The only change was the addition of giant hunter's/Aston Martin green saucer-like ashtrays to shield the street-cleaning men from the virus.",,

Two Japanese girls approached me and I apologized for my condition. One spoke to me in Japanese and I just happened to understand her perfectly and responded fluently, which pleased me, but then I thought they would be disappointed if they continued to speak in Japanese and realized my ability was very limited. They took me to a kitchen where we all put on light blue uniforms and prepared to cook. She started giving me instructions in Japanese, and switched to English when they got complicated, so we didn't have any communication difficulties. We were making noodles in a bucket, mostly by hand but using a press with holes in it (Western-style, in contrast to stretching the noodles after the usual Asian fashion). I made both thin noodles and thick ones (swapping out presses with differently sized holes), and I was pleased how well they were turning out, since I had not used this method before. The first girl laid her noodles near a fire to firm up, and I set mine aside to wait until there was room to follow suit. I wasn't sure if I had accidentally started a new job, or if this was just a one-off class I was crashing, but I was enjoying the process of learning a new skill. ",,

I was in the actual dining room here (Normally, my abode is entirely different than the one I have IRL, yet I accept it.)  I looked through the thin Tudor windows to the west and all I saw was a giant wall of ocean wave magnifying as it drew closer.  My (now dead) mother was taking a shower in the master bath.  There was no time to warn her, so my brain quickly surmised the effects inside that bathroom.  I realized the glass shower walls would break into her; yet the house would be tindersticks in moments.  It probably wouldn't matter.  She was the only person here I had to worry about.  No pets in this dream.    Now I could determine where is the best place for me to stand when this wall of water hits the house.  All I could think was to dive headfirst into the wave, as a surfer would do.  But the dining room windows are too thin.  But they soon would be gone....with the Douglas firs and wood and bricks all preventing me from jumping forward.    I realize the open backyard is my best bet; however it is too late and the wave is here.  I am about to dive as soon as the wall opens, then I realize the wave is so large the swell just passes underneath the house.  I am amazed.  Belongings and furniture are uprooted, yet everything is okay, for the most part.  I ponder how I failed to consider this option for the tsunami.  My mom is fine, marvelously excited but intact. Then I realize neighbors most likely will experience a far worse fate.  With that thought, I awaken.    Once back to sleep, I am living in a ""post-wave"" society.  Conversations revolve around what life was like before the tsunami.  I wish I could remember the rest of the dreams.

10754S,"It's after 11pm, and I didn't make much effort to remember last nights dreams.    Scene: I was in the car, which was parked and facing the building I was to enter. The door to the building was about 20ft away, and it would have been no problem if the ground was flat, but there was a flight of stairs between me and the entrance.  The side door on the left was the same level at the parking spaces near that side of the building, but the parking lots were not connected. There was no way for me to drive from the parking lot I was in to the parking lot that had handicapable access to the building. I would have to drive back out onto the street and find the entrance to the other parking lot. However, neither parking lot was visible from the street due to the presence of many buildings, I was in an unfamiliar city with a complicated street system such as one-way streeets and thoroughfares without access to side streets, and I did not have GPS or a map. Essentially, I could see the accessible parking lot, but it was not possible for me to get there.    Scene: I was standing outside in a pedestrian area. It may have been an outdoor shopping area. (Those are common in California.) One building was a cheap pancake restaurant, like House of Pancakes or iHop. The other had cowboy hats in the display window. There were people patronizing both places without masks. I was pleased, thinking that the patrons would get sick with COVID and fewer of them would be alive to vote for the presidential candidate that I don't care for come November.  I walked along and suddenly felt compelled to enter spur the cowboy shop. Inside I passed southwestern silver and turquoise jewelry, and found myself in a tiny room packed with Southwest Asian clothes that was lightweight and covered the arms and legs to protect the skin from the sun. I was quite surprised to see such items. After looking at the selection, I left without having to go back the way I came; the tiny Asian room had a door that opened up onto a street.    Scene: There were students my age standing together outside on an unusually wide sidewalk in front of a large stone building. (I don't rember if they were actual people from grad school.)  They had been playing with a tennis ball and someone must have missed because it came towards me. They did not intentionally throw it to me for me to catch and then join them. I did try to catch the tennis ball, which I was going to throw back to them, but it was just a bit too far out in front of me, and I can't run, so it couldn't run after it. It bounced once on the sidewalk and then went into the street.  (Real life: the disability discrimination at grad school was terrible.)    Scene: I saw a small bird on the sidewalk that had a stripe of energy, consisting of the primary colors, running lengthwise from it's head to it's bum. From those three colors anything could be created.    Scene: I was walking along a street. (An activity I can not do in real life.) The street curved sharply to the left. The curve in the road was a literal turning point. Up to the curve it was a safe, economically viable street. Beyond the curve, it was seedy, and progressively degraded as I continued. The seedy portion of the street was not visible from the socio-economically well-off part of the street. A short distance from the curve, the street dead-ended in a cul-de-sac. The cup-de-sac had unwashed, unkempt homeless people - some mentally ill, some on drugs, and one who was also in a wheelchair. There were two old Victorian houses at the end of the cup-de-sac behind those people. The houses were just as neglected as the people. Being Victorians, the houses had intricate carvings in the wood, but the beautiful carvings were all damaged.  In some places the paint had been globed on so thick it filled the carvings, and in other places the paint had worn off and the wood was exposed and worn down. Going back the other direction, there was a big stone edifice with stone steps leading up to it - a university building or a hall of justice - located just after the curve. It was the first building on the wealthier side of the curve and it was not visible from the poor & neglected end of the street. My cousin and her two daughters were there. Something about taking my cousin's older daughter to see what life is like for the destitute, but leaving the younger 4 yr old there with my cousin so she wouldn't see that side of life.  Martin from BC was there. (I forget how he featured into the dream.)   (I think this dream had something to do with the poor quality of my health insurance, which was highlighted on Wed. I had planned to deliver a letter today because my Dr is going to file a complaint on my behalf.)",,
14309L,"It's all a blur now, but I remember awakening at 3:32 am and thinking, ""I've only been asleep for a little longer than one hour?""  I felt as if I dreamed forever.  Something about travel and an extra barrier we were forced against COVID-19 to wear that looked like a transparent plastic shower cap.  At one point, I passed a mirror and saw a spider crawling up near my forehead hairline, under the cap, and I was not allowed to remove the cap.  I'm not arachnophobic; but it was unsettling to try to remove it with my fingers as forceps, rather than a sweeping motion off my head.",,

The whole time, I knew I shouldn't marry him because of our lifestyle differences.    At another point I dreamt I was flying on such a luxurious airplane that I had the equivalent of a hotel room all to myself, including a large closet and lots of floor space. The airplane even had decks like a cruise ship, though the doors were locked while we were airborne. Other passengers had smaller but still very nice cabins, a bit like what you'd see on an old train, with daybeds covered in rich brocades. But when we got off the plane, I realised I'd left my carry on bags on board. I was walking by the side of a really bleak highway with an aunt and uncle I don't know well, and we had to turn back - all very awkward.    At other points I was meeting a friend at a restaurant, only to find she was dating a really dangerous sort of aristocratic British scoundrel. And then later I was shopping at Trader Joe's, but everyone was speaking German and I kept forgetting to keep my mask on.  ",,
30016S,"It's hazy but I seemed to be in the early stages of dating someone who both was and wasn't quite my husband. He was a lot younger and more boyish looking, with the swagger teenagers sometimes have when they know they're attractive to girls. It was sort of sweet but we also had some kind of argument about sex, the details of which I can't quite remember.    There was a later dream of four or five unusually beautiful ghosts (teenage girls and their mother) snuggled up along the side of a moor. They woke up and floated down to the beach, drawn in by something that was like a gorgeous sunset but for the moon, in greens, blues, and purples. I'm not sure if I was watching them or if I was one of them, but someone dipped her toe into the sea and dissolved into the waves.",,

We were doing something social and it was clear she wasn't doing well - she was in ugly old pyjamas and part of her scalp was bleeding.    Then in a separate dream my husband and I were on a date at a shopping center in the middle of some kind of exurb area. Inexplicably, the interior of one of the buildings was covered in beautiful Mediterranean tiles. We talked about the architecture and how weird this was. The conversation turned to the cycles of wealth and poverty over the centuries in different parts of France and Italy, and how they influenced architectural styles. Then, rather abruptly, we were trying to decide how to renovate a little house we'd inherited.",,

16768S,"Jenny H and I met up and decided to have a picnic. She asked if we should ask our mutual friend to come but I said she would be working now. We were outside of my house which was either a dormitory or apartment building. We were in her car already but I said I have some stuff I could bring in my apartment, should I go get it? I have a blanket we could sit on. She said sure so I rushed inside. Inside there was a concert and lots of people milling about. Performers were in different spots in the house taking turns playing. I grabbed my things and someone announced a girl was playing violin in the bathroom. I went to go see. I got an email forwarded from Jenny that our food was ready to be picked up or was out for delivery. Me and one other person besides the performer were the only ones in the bathroom. I thought I should leave now so I'm not leaving while she's playing. I went downstairs and then I was in my car. I think maybe I didn't find Jenny so I drove to meet her but I don't remember. I was at a stop light and decided to park at the Shoppers Drug Mart just past the light and let Jenny know I would wait for her there. While I was stopped I texted her. I tried staying aware of the light and my foot on the brake because I was not an experienced driver (I do not know how to drive in real life). The light changed and I turned into the parking lot very gracefully. When I tried to park I accidentally accelerated instead of braking and had trouble directing the car. I nearly ran over a tiny tiny car that was parked. Finally I turned into a spot for some kind of maintenance machine, not a parking spot, and my car turned from very big to very small.¬†    I was talking with Harriet who was telling me that she had just been stuck in a hole in the ground without a phone and had to wait for someone to come find her and help her out.¬†    I was in the kitchen with Hayley and Jac. We heard an alarm and I said that's a fire alarm. They seemed unbothered. I looked outside and there were huge white clouds of smoke coming out of our neighbor's house. I said let's go look! There was a truck in the back with lots of animals inside -- raccoons? Dogs? I don't remember. Then a bunch of dogs and cats came out of the house. Some you could tell were strays and others were pets. A huge pig like Bikini from the wolfgang instagram page came out, too. I pet the dogs and the pig and a firefighter said that some of the animals would be released.¬†",,

15226L,"Last dream: Unfamiliar house and my son and daughter were grade school age. It might have been Easter and my Mom might have been one of the other adults there. We always celebrated Easter with my parents or with her after my Dad died.  The kids had gotten gifts and each had gotten a container of jelly beans. I had specified small jelly beans, like Jellybellies, but the containers had the big ones, which I didn't think taste as good. My attitude was ""Oh well. Better than nothing and they may not care.""    We were going out for dinner even though it was already 21:00 when I looked at a wall clock. I was concerned restaurants would be closing and thought we should call ahead. I suggested one restaurant that had been a favorite place and was told they had gone out of business. Also told that the one we were going to stayed open until 23:00.    I was getting ready and went into a small, hall bathroom, much like ours, that had a large wall mirror over the sink, but the lighting fixtures were different as was the position of the vent fan, which was in the wall and not the ceiling. There were 2 light fixtures above the sink, one above the other. The one flush with the ceiling was a regular incandescent which gave off a yellow, dimmer light. The one below it was a circular compact tube. I wondered how they were able to be mounted in that position. The fluorescent light gave off a sharp bright white light. There were 3 switches on the wall and each should have controlled one device. When I flicked the wall switch for just a light, nothing happened. None of them worked. Then I flicked the middle one up and down multiple times and there was a sizzling noise. The both of the lights would partially light or come on but then fade out. The fan was also trying to start. Eventually I got them both to turn on as well as the fan, and stay on. I was hurriedly putting on liquid face makeup and noticing that the makeup only partially covered the years of acne scarring under the fluorescent light. I mused that I'd have to look into other brands for a better coverup. That it was a shame that my skin was finally clear but the damage done had left permanent traces.  I had a serious background concern that  the faulty switch/light issue had the potential to start a fire and woke up at the point thinking I'd have to ask my husband if that was a possibility.  Self analysis: In hosing off our deck yesterday I had  gotten a covered wall switch wet and it had tripped a breaker,,which has happened in the past. However, it never happens when it rains and my husband said he isn't sure what the issue is. Electrical issues always worry me as I see them as potential fire threats.  We are people who ate out at least 2 times a week before Covid19. We remain in quarantine and will continue to avoid even carry out for as long as people continue to get the virus. Thus, we won't be going out to eat again until the ""11th hour.""  As for the kids and presents, it has long been my experience that when I specify a certain gift to a family member, they generally don't get what I tell them to buy. And ""if I want it done right, I have to do it myself."" Something my mother would often say. Father's Day is this weekend and I made a suggestion to our daughter but I don't expect that she will get what I recommenced. Her tendency is to hit the ""As seen on TV aisle"" in a drugstore at the last minute. So that's what I'm expecting to happen, once again.  I WILL be asking my husband about light switches today! Lol.",,
25154S,"Last dream. Again with elaborate details.  Not sure of the location. But sure that it's not home. Maybe European again and on another of my husband's business trips. I usually spent my days out on my own. The area is more country/suburban and definitely not city. I am using a bike to get around. I encounter a young teen girl that interests me. We chat at length. She gives me a first name, which I promptly forget. I am bad at holding onto names,   I go out the next day. Have to cross a busy multi lane highway to get into the middle lane, which is a dedicated bike lane. I find it strange that the bike lane isn't the curb lane. I am going to a library, looking for a specific author. Name begins with ""L"" but can't recall it now. Think it was a philosophy book. Before I find my book, I see the girl there with a young guy. I find out that they're highschool seniors, working on a school project together. They are also band mates in a rock band. They are wearing black leather jackets with studs and other trimmings. Also tee shirts with photo prints that I don't bother to decipher. I tell her that I don't recall her last name ( a lie because she had never told me) and she tells me her last name is Pelatoni and the band name is The Pelatonians. We are making small talk. She has a terrible case of acne and my thought is that in today's world there is much dermatologists could do to clear it up for her and wonder why she has gotten help. But, I can't say that at this point,.  Her father shows up, dressed in a business suit, maybe about 50. Grey suit, white shirt with a thin stripe, tie, Sandy colored short hair, thin face, tall, medium build. Again polite chitchat and he tells her they have to go. I tell her that I hope we cross paths again. And they leave and I wake up.",,

I was there with my parents and my in-laws and the clinic staff was asking me if I wanted everyone to come back with me to see the results. I was confused because I thought it was too early to really see anything on the ultrasound and wasn't sure I wanted anyone there for a transvaginal ultrasound.When I went, the dr was going to see me but left and didn't come back. I proceeded to leave the clinic and go on some crazy adventure around the city. At some point during the dream I even broke into a prison I think. Talked to some inmates. At another point I was in a cafeteria and figuring out what I wanted to eat and what food they had. Towards the end of the dream the dr told me my test results. Said I was pregnant with twins and showed me the ultrasound picture. I became livid because I knew it was someone else's test results because they never came back to do my ultrasound. But then there were no employees to talk to at the clinic about this error.",,

3891L,"Last night's dreams are difficult to describe, as they were fictional and did not abide by the physical realities of life on Earth.   One dream involved a type of motel suspended in the air, with no walkway between the rooms. Instead there were sliding doors, so you held onto the handle of the sliding door and slide across the width of that room, then like a monkey swinging through the trees you had to grab the handle of the next sliding door and slide the width of that room. This dream involved girls I did gymnastics with as a kid.    Another dream involved hanging from something, again in the sky. One of my best friend's from BC was there. I distinctly remember holding my mechanical blue pencil in my mouth because my hands were occupied holding onto whatever the contraption was in the sky, and realizing if I dropped the pencil it would fall into the indefiniate space below so I'd better have a good grip so I wouldn't fall. To achieve this, I got down, moved a chair, and then climbed back up, (the way I do in real life when doing something like changing a lightbulb around the house when I don't bother to get the step stool out and I need to move the chair closer to reach my target) and then I was back in the sky-scape world.  Another dream took place hundreds of years ago, when women were expected to wear long dresses and marry. The men were playing some sort of game, akin to primitive golf. I had built a tall wooden pedestal thing, and then I put my dirt-clot ball down at the base nestled in one of the grooves of the pedestal, and then all I had to do was spin my pedestal contraption and it propelled my dirt-clot ball into the air further than any of the men were able to propel their dirt-clot balls. I won without doing any activities that women weren't supposed to do. In another part of that dream, a man lost a hand because of me, but he wasn't angry because we were a very well-matched couple and, as the dirt-clot ball story demonstrates, I was much more interesting than the other women in the dream.

I had some kind of discussion with the husband about this, and he acknowledged my concerns. I had delivered a still born baby but  didn't go thru labor and delivery in the dream. There was an understanding that I could have many more babies, until one was delivered that was alive and ok. The wife had some doubts about continuing the process.  She was an English teacher (I once was in real life) and I am next, shadowing her in a classroom. I am watching from a corner of the classroom and prepares to help her out if she asked.

We were on flying brooms. Then I was on my way home in an uber with a coworker I didn't recognize. We were driving through somewhat familiar boston landscape. Then the song Que  Pretendes by Bad Bunny and J Balvin began playing and it's like my dream turned into a music video. At this point it was evening, it followed a stream of aqua light that connected the street lights. Then we came upon a building at the edge of water, perhaps in Seaport √°rea. It had dark blue reflective glass all around and was somewhat short and cylindrical with the top looked like it was cut on the diagonal. My view panned around this building like I was floating on the water, the jet of aqua light also moving around the building. The music video ended with my uncle fishing on a rocky jetty near the building. Then for some reason I had the view of my old friend Vanessa's twitter feed which had tweets about her opinions of other people I knew. When I saw my name, there was a link and when I went to click it I woke up.     Earlier in the night before I woke up at around 5. also dreamt of being stuck almost in a place I had to figure out to escape. There was a giant statue of Bad Bunny, as well as what looked like spotlights of electricity which had dementors (from Harry Potter) behind them. When I got out of there, I met up with my boyfriend Alejandro and his friend Sara. We were first in a huge library with lots of windows on a sunny day. Then we went to a park where we smoked weed. There was a large dog who I played with. Later that night we were together in cambridge to eat indian food. Then boys from my high school appeared which bothered me so I left the conversation. There was a tiger cub and baby otter which came to me and I played and cuddled with. When they left I noticed that the sky's constellations were lit up and connected like a map, and there were even some who were illustrated more in detail and in color. It looked amazing, I alerted the others and moved closer to the charles river for a better view. ",,

Pass a line of men, barely visible thru the snow. They're waiting to use a public restroom. I rule that out as too dangerous. Many look homeless. I hold on to her with my arm around her. We keep going and meet a female police officer. She looks like an English Bobby, because of her uniform. She gets us to some kind of public building where there is a line of women waiting to be processed. Not sure why. But she puts the woman I'm helping into the line near the front. Others object that she should go to the back, but the officer says it's critical she be seen sooner, the woman has blood on her arm. Is dressed in a sleeveless shirt, Bermuda shorts. Arms crossed. I believe she has other injuries as well. I nod to her that it's ok, she should stay where she is. I wonder if this is immigration or a hospital. Worried for her but going back out isn't an option either,  2.  Middle school age boys playing basketball. I am associated with one group. There's a boy in my group that is very short but seems to be the team ""character"" The game starts and because my group isn't paying attention, the other team scores 2 goals with my guys not watching, standing in a bunch together. My short guy gets the ball but can't begin to shoot high enough to make a basket. He takes the ball off to the side and is deflating it because he says he'll be able to make the basket with a softer ball,. I don't expect the ball will bounce, but it does. The team shorts and shirts are yellow and white.  3. Some kind of industrial, space age looking facility, I'm with a group, either an observer or trainee too, in space suits, attaching or repairing sections of hoses. One guy is impulsive. Thinks he knows what he's doing but doesn't, attaches 2 pieces together that don't belong together, the group rushes over to help, and all of us, holding on to the hoses as a group, are blown up a large, sloping grey concrete wall that is part of the facility structure.  4. The ""team of boys"";had beena room with a very large bed. Or perhaps some kind of matress on the floor. I see that the white sheet and mattress pad hav fresh urine stains. Wonder if some or someone has an incontinence problem or if it's just their age.

I'm running through a building with wide hallways, foyers and there is a large, stocky, matronly woman in a dark dress, bulky hat reminiscent of a BBC character, standing with her back to a large expanse of paned, floor to ceiling windows, spattered with rain drops. The light from the windows leaves her face obscured in shadow. I'm thinking that she is not taking kindly to my rushing past her. I am at least 10 feet away from her.

She has nice hair in both worlds: dream and real. i wound up with the shitty end of the hair stick in both worlds, at least in this dream. i wanted to know which products she uses to wash and condition her hair, as even though our hair is different as to it's appearance, it is sort of the same, in both worlds. She was more than willing to tell me the shampoo, but very hush-hush on the conditioner. It took some serious effort to pull it out of her, and then it was only because she said she knew i could never afford the conditioner in my lifetime. She showed me, and at first i was disconcerted seeing the price tag of 1200 on it. That would be out of my range both literally, and even if i decided to save for something, it would never be stupid conditioner..i could pay two of my kids rent for that amount..buy all of the grandbabies and kids presents..and i was just staring at it thinking how ridiculous, when i realized: the price was in pesos.",,
12208S,"Many dreams, but the only one I recall is I was travelling with my work group.  From point A to point B, we had to take a ship.  I was so excited to be on the water, but the trip only was maybe one minute from dock to dock.  It just linked us to the next parallel dock.  Once off the ship, we walked along a breakwater to an airport.  Inside the airport was a small hotel and we were given rooms to share.  Somehow we all became separated on our ways to eat; so I ate alone with an older couple standing, waiting for their order very close to my table.  We began chatting, then I had to get up.  When I returned to the table, my purse was open on the table, but the couple remained there.  I calmly-on-the-outside, panicked-on-the-inside looked inside and at first thought my wallet and passport were missing.  Eventually, I found them, felt incredible relief, and then went to the room.  I discovered my neighbor Laramie, with whom I work IRL, was my roommate.  She barely said hello, but she did not seem meanspirited, merely tired.  I started accounting for my belongings and I turn around to find many young black people on the beds.  When I determine we all had paid for the same room, we all just accepted the situation and remained together in the room.  I remember thinking how refreshing it was no one was mad at one another for the greed of the hotel.  ",,
20363L,"Many dreams. But can only recall parts of one:  Driving in a car on a small 2 lane road. Don't recall if I was the driver or a passenger. Passing through a barren field. Could be light colored sand or snow, both sides of the road. A few tree stirmps. Either it was bulldozed or something natural had happened to clear the area. At the edge of the field there was an extremely poor, dilapidated neighborhood in view. On my left I could see weathered jagged boards hanging on what I first thought was a house. As I got closer, it was actually the remnants of a tree house. The houses on both sides were shacks, in terrible shape. This looked like things I've  in the Deep South. That neighborhood gave way to somewhat better, modest houses, but my guess was, low income. Then, the housing became more middle class. I saw or imagined upper class, well to do homes in the distance. My thought was that there were always these economic layers. The very wealthy were never that far away from the poor and couldn't live their lives without them. I've had this perspective for years in my waking life, but surprised that I was reminding myself of this in a dream setting. Perhaps because I've had heavy discussions with my 20 somethings who are to the ""very far left"" of Bernie and desiring social justice and change....",,

There was snow on the ground and she was dressed for summer. I picked her up and started to carry her back to a home. Didn't look like my house. I had gently asked her basic questions. She was maybe 6 years old but was so petite and light weight that she looked younger. She gave me a first name. And, eventually, a street address. She said she was alone, no adults. But that there was a baby boy at the address, in a crib. Maybe a year old, not a newborn. Wherever place I was staying at, I was trying to call the police. But the emergency  numbers posted by the phone weren't correct. I was trying various numbers, getting frustrated, holding her with one arm, on my left hip, the whole time.

I figured out some clever way to take it on and off without having to unfasten it when I was awarded it. On the way home, it was dark, either raining or snowing, so I decide not to drive all the way back and start looking for a place to stay. It's night, rural and I don't know the area. I see a sign but the name is misleading, it looks like a very large nice, but old house And I assume it's a B&B.  A pleasant, very blond 40 something woman with her hair in a pony tail welcomes us (I think my kids were with me but grade school age) and says she can accommodate us. She takes me upstairs to a room full of beds with odd looking people already asleep in them. She indicates I should sleep between 2 very large, grotesque looking twins whose coloring is grey and they look like cartoon hippos or rhinos minus horns. I am stunned and then realize it's a home for disabled and mentally handicapped people. I tell the kids/others to wait up, that this isn't going to work out. I apologize to the woman and say we wouldn't want to disturb the residents. I then keep chatting with her, a bit embarrassed because I don't want her to be offended. I show her the pink bra and my trick for being able to take it on or off over my clothes.  2. I am at a mailbox inside a large apartment building. I put in the key, but it also wants a code and I suddenly don't recall which one we use. Others approach, so I pretend I am finished and move off to a bench in the side. I may have one of my kids with me, but someone is. When the people leave, I go back to the box and get it open but discover it is completely packed. I start to take out the mail. The box is very deep and a bit high up, so that I am eye level with it. At the back are numerous bottles and containers with all sorts of products. I then remember checking off boxes for free samples in a magazine or online. I can't quite reach to the back of the box to retrieve them. So, I close the box as if I am done because others have approached. Again, we move off to the bench on the side. At some point my husband shows up and Intell him about the samples, in the box and ask him to retrieve fhem. It is going to be awkward trying to carry them all.  3. A mail carrier comes along while I am still getting things out of my box. The person proceeds to lock the mailboxes and I shout that someone should stop the person (because I am not done and not sure of the code) and suddenly someone runs up with a machine gun and kills the carrier with multiple shots. I am shocked that they mistook my shouting ""Stop"" as a reason to kill the person.",,
20246S,"Many. But 2 snippets.  Was in a car with 3 other people. (Another car dream!).i wasn't driving but knew the woman who was. I think she was a neighbor. The other 2 people were a couple that are our closest friends here in MA. We were going to a venue together. Restaurant, convention, concert, show...something large. I has told the driver where to park but she didn't listen and went to the main parking lot in front of the venue, which I knew would be full already. From precious experience I knew there weee also several small lots down a small paved side street that people didn't seem to know about, which is wheee I had parked in the past, she drove right on by them and never turned her head to look.She was going to head back to the main lot and keep circling it for a parking spot. I told her to let us out and we'd meet her there. She let us out on the street where the other 2 lots were. Still empty. I pointed them out to my friends as we were cutting through one, walking back to the venue. I ran up behind Larry and grabbed the back of his shoulders, playfully. This move was out of character because in real life, Larry is stiff and formal and I'd never touch him. I am not at all attracted to him, he has a tendency to be a ""know it all"" and annoying, but I have come to appreciate him, intellectually. I think the person driving the car cast a swing vote in a neighborhood election...for the ""other side"" and can't be trusted. We are on the same political page (and most other things) with the couple in the car. I suspect this dream was about the election.  Dream 2. I was at someplace like Burger King,  but indoors. I placed an order for a burgee and fries for everyone with me. Maybe 8 of us. The clerk comes out with 2 fries and 4 burgers. I am upset about the order and am talking to the clerk about it. She says there is no more, I say we placed our order before others did and it should have been filled first. The only thing I can think to do is to split up what we got into equal portions so everyone gets something. I.e., a quarter of a burger each. I don't think people were happy with this solution.

One set of people, maybe family, was in one large room ( perhaps a suite, rental house, hotel room) and my parents and others were in a gated place. I had gone to check on them and was going back to my location. A woman, my age or younger, was driving the car. She wasn't a total stranger but not an acquaintance either. The place where my parents were staying had a huge stone wall around the grounds, rather like a castle wall. The exit was a gate in this wall and had armed guards. The woman handed her driver's license to a guard who then asked her about her husband's whereabouts. She snapped at him that her husband was dead as she snatched the license out of his hand and sped off. She explained that the license was fake and that she couldn't have answered any questions related to the name on the card and couldn't risk them double checking on her because she had no back story set up for the fake card. This also meant I couldn't easily go back and check on my parents. I had told people at both locations we would have to wait, but I don't recall why.

I had a lot of stuff everywhere but it looked very chic and cozy. I offered them food and drink. Matthew wanted an iced coffee and some other drink. I looked in the fridge and told Sylvia what I had. I found some tempeh I had left over and offered her a sandwich. She said yes.   (Next part, or maybe a separate dream) Chanel and I were on the bus but we weren't sitting together. I looked out the window and realized that we were going in the wrong direction, based on the stops we were passing. I considered getting out immediately, but I wasn't sure when the bus going the right way would be coming, and I didn't want to miss it as I crossed the street or wait outside very long. I knew the end of the line was Forest Hills. I got Chanel's attention and asked if she was also going uptown. She said yes, and I told her that the bus was going the wrong way, but that we could just stay on the bus since it was almost at Forest Hills and it turned around from there.  (Later, or separate dream again): I was at a bar, sitting at a high table on a stool, with Chris H. We were drinking beers. He told me that his grandparent had died, and he was going through a catalogue of his grandparent's things and that he and his relatives were in some kind of conflict about who inherited what. Then I was at the bar alone, cutting up paper for some kind of juvenile art project. The waitress came over and said ""that's the happiest 29-year-old I've ever seen."" I went out to the balcony of the bar, and when I came back there was a stapled packet of printer paper with my name (or the waitress' name, I forget) written in highlighter. Inside was both the bill and the money I paid for the meal. The waitress was gone; her shift had ended so she had left it there for me.  Then I was at some kind of conference in Italy. I wished that I had stayed with the group of people I was with before, or that I had a friend there to explore the city with. I was walking down a street and in front of me was a tv production crew, filming something. I looked ahead and the building in front of me had a mirage effect that the producers had created. It looked hand-drawn, and was kind of wiggling. It was meant to look like a New York City building, but we were in LA. I was amazed -- it looked so real even though I knew it was an illusion. A producer, a middle-aged woman, had headphones and wavy blond hair and was directing the traffic. I walked closer to the building and saw that it was a Boston-themed store. It was a store that was meant to be built in NYC but never was, so they ""built"" it for the show. I asked someone if it was okay to take a photo and they said yes. I took a photo and video. I kept walking onto a busy street (the street with the building illusion was a quieter, more residential street). There were lots of people there, in the middle of the road, and no cars. I saw up ahead beyond the crowd a beautiful stone cathedral. I wished I still had my city map with the landmarks marked out. ",,

We discuss what we'll be doing and seeing and walking to the next day.  We get back to our hotel after dark. Restaurants are closed and we're all hungry. There is a small section of the restaurant, with a cafeteria like fee, that has a light on and a peeson at the cash register. There are people sitting at tables in a small darkened dining area, finishing up their meals. I go to the cold case and see they have some small milk cartons. I think, ""Well, that will do for protein."" And I also get a selection of snack foods but no longer recall what. We get in the elevator to head to our floor, which is the 4th. The elevator stops at 3 ans ""our boy"" rushes out with other people. I get out shine holding the door open and tell him to come back, that it's not our floor. He yells something back and keeps going. I look at the wall next to the elevator door to confirm the floor and someone has written a crude #3 in black marker on the wall. I have a sense that there are renovations going on. I get back in the elevator, figuring the boys will have to come back to it and we go to the 4th floor without him. However, it's not the right floor. The boy was right. They had altered the number of the floors. So, we go back down, and I  get to the room first. The boy is floating and being insulting.  I shock myself by telling him that ai hate him. I leave the room,,upset with myself for saying something like that to a child.    2.

21988L,"Multi  1. Was with another woman. I think she was applying d'or a job but the job was in a very different language. One that she and I didn't know. I didn't think it was going to be something she could fake when I looked at it printed out. I saw a lot of ""O's"" and couldn't begin to guess what it said. She was going to go ahead anyhow and she thought she could fake it. She goes in to proceed with the interview and/or intake process.  2. I was with my Mom and probably my daughter as a teen. Or at least the 3rd person was female and much younger. We were making roast duck, a typical family dish. Plus mashed potatoes and a veggie. My Mom was insisting that I also quarter some potatoes and roast them next to the duck. I objected since this is something one does with a pork or beef roast but duck has too much fat to do that. However she was insistent. So, I complied. The duck was in a small roaster. She set the temp high at 475. We were supposed to go out to the grocery store, drop off some used Christmas cards at someone's house where they would be used for crafting and I can't recall the 3rd stop. I told her that it was going to take more than 30 minutes, I estimated well over an hour,mand the duck would get overcooked and tough, maybe burnt. She insisted we'd be back in time. I knew that we wouldn't. When she wasn't looking, I turned the heat down to 400 and reset the timer for 90 minutes instead of 30.   We left. I was driving. We made the stop to drop off the cards in an older, classy suburban neighborhood with many brick Tudor style houses. Then we went on to the grocery store and a 3rd stop. (Lost those details) We return, the duck is done, not burnt, nice and golden,  but I am concerned about the texture, that it might be rubbery from the different timing on the cooking. I test it with a meat thermometer to make sure it's really done. I also decided the meal could use some color. I deliberate between using orange marmalade or opening a can of cranberry sauce. I decide on the cranberry sauce because it is more substantial and will round out the plates food with a lot more color.   Self analysis: Much in those dreams has to do with current day to day family events. A family member is looking for jobs but she doesn't have a lot of qualifications. Just a lot of false bravado. My mother was a difficult person for all of us. Very dominant, would not have been right about her cooking decision in the dream, although she could be a good cook. I didn't argue with her often. I just did what I did in the dream, and worked around her. I was dealing with some family members in a similar fashion last night. One can't talk them out of what they are doing, so I tread carefully, watch what I say, and try to get them to a better outcome. In both cases, the 2 people I was dealing with in the dream couldn't see the bigger picture or have the ability to anticipate the potential outcome from their poor decision making. I think I was reminding myself to continue to be patient. That I have dealt with these kinds of behaviors for most of my life and being upfront with this type of person only ends up with angry,  upset people and then there is no hope for helping them to an ultimately better outcome for all of us or a lesson learned for them.",,
22947S,"Multi  One dream involved dormitory living but zero details remain.  Last dream: I arrived at a meeting at the bottom level of a building. Essentially a basement level for the building but the door was level with the outside. There are 2 rooms and the door is closed to the 2nd room where a large group of men are meeting. One can hear the male voices thru the adjoining wall but can't make out what is being said.  Everyone is already there for my meeting, I sit near the door, on a folding chair, near the person who is apparently in charge. She is tall, heavy set, unattractive, with blond/grey hair that is poorly cut short/medium length sticking out here and there. No obvious hair style. Some votes are taken and we are supposed to close our eyes and raise our hands in response to the questions. I can't make out the questions, so leak to see if others have their hands up or down and try to do whatever others are doing. I have to keep peaking because I don't know when a question/hand count has ended ans a new question is being asked. That finishes ans then she is trying to tally up the votes and needs to know how many people are there. I am now helping her. There is one group that is sitting at a long, cafeteria style table at the far side of the room. I count 10 people and the total is 50 people. That is the only table, the room is brightly lit with overhead lights, and everyone else is dens packed in sitting on chairs at all sorts of angles. No rows or organization. I wonder if she really counted the others accurately or not, as she struggles to reconcile the votes vs the attendees. I think she should have people count off, and I could take over, but I'm not sure I want to get that involved or if the results really matter. End of dream. Lol",,

The scene switches with the same people but the house is mine and the place is is being used as a sample for some legal measurements. There are 2 men and 1 is measuring walls, doors, etc. And asks me to sign off on paperwork but says he needs to also see the deed. I am trying to scan the paperwork to get a sense of what I am signing. The paperwork is thick with carbon copies and and I am going to press very hard to get my signature to show up on all of them. I remember my husband is on the premises somewhere, call him, and he proceeds to go get the deed out of the safe because he knows exactly what they want.  Meanwhile the women are still there. They see a photo of my son as a 2 year old and say how sweet he is. I say he is there and bring him out to show him off to the women.  My now deceased Basenji dog is also there. (Long deceased-1990) but She was also very talented . However, in the dream she could actually talk. I am holding her in my arms and give her a treat and then ask her where the treats come from ans she says ""Ohio"" and then I ask her where we are and she says ""Ohio"".   4 Maternal cousins arrive but now we are at The Farm, family property in Ohio that I used to co own with my estranged brother.  I know I should introduce them to all of the other women there, but have forgotten everyone's name, which is a typical problem I have always had.  My daughter is now also there,. But as a 30 year old. She is attached to the property and never wants me to sell it. It's been a long running discussion between us. I tell them all that the large field on the south side had once been all swamp when I was a kid but my Dad had filled it in. However, with no one there on a regular basis since we live out of state, it's going to revert to swamp land. I also say they on the other side of that field, past the tree line, there is a county dump.    Self analysis: The dreams are about multiple personal, family estate, and legal issues I am dealing with or have been dealing with for a long time. I know what each of them are in real life, like being involved with my paternal cousin's estate since she died without a will. We are going to see a vet tonight because our 17 year old cat (who is also very talented!) is approaching the end of her life, we think. And we have decided not to have any more pets because of our ages (74 and 76). I've also been trying to reacquaint myself with all of our legal paperwork since my husband took it all on when my cancer treatments almost killed me in 2013. And, we have been discussing what to do with the 40 acres of Ohio land that we own and our daughter wants to keep on the family. But we think we should sell it if we get the chance. Finally, a group of women friends want me to get together with them, but because of my husband's comorbidities, his PC has advised us to stay in quarantine, so I keep turning them down.. Aren't dreams interesting when one can figure out what one is telling oneself!  ",,

I tried  pulling on some cloth pieces under it, but couldn't get it to move. Realized it was too heavy. I was then on a bench.  I'm in an indoor setting, like a large industrial space but not much in sight. High ceilings. I am very tired and lie down on the bench. It's the kind of bench one would find in parks, but not metal.   And then my alarm went off and I woke up very tired. I suspect I was just about to drop off into a deeper sleep.",,
26720S,"Multi but lost most of it.  I am living in what seems like a modern condo row house. My daughter is there. Hair cut very short and she is visibly pregnant. Wearing a long, thin cotton, white top with a small blue print .  I get a call saying the shipment of items I supposedly ordered for $300+ is about to be delivered. I say I've ordered nothing and refuse to accept delivery or the charges. However, the d'aller hangs up.  At which point, a 20-30:something guy walks in carrying a very large flat box. He is thin, dark hair, thin mustache, and a bit sleazy looking. I am telling him to leave, I didn't order whatever, when he opens the lid. There is a very large variety of items. Some appear to be sewing notions, things  like zippers. He says he still has to bring in the rest of the order. I am telling him this order isn't mine. My daughter is also talking to him. I am trying to lighten up the conversation, I am trying to help him get to a logical conclusion, if this isn't some kind of scam. Which is my suspicion. I also know my daughter isn't married.   Self analysis: My daughter has had many difficulties, but I have been coming to terms with them. She does try to help and is good with handling people.  So, here I am dealing with unexpected issues and figuring out how I'll handle them is my guess.  ",,

One has won many medals. There is something written that says something about 70 year olds. The one friend has been dead since April 2019. And she looks terrific, not ill,  like she would have been at that time. She also never competed in things like the other woman who has won many medals. I realize all of this in my dream when I am doing my calculations and then start telling myself it must be getting late and I need to wake up. Which I don't really want to do because I want to try to recall the previous dreams but it gets pointless.  I am finding it interesting that I am dreaming about different people in my life every night. And that they are dead, alive, from my distant past or in my present.

25804S,"Multi detailed and elaborate. Last 2 recalled:    1. I think I was back working in a rehab setting.There was a young girl, maybe about 10, with multiple casts. At least an arm and a leg. I think she had tried to elope, was being difficult and I was working with her, to try to get her back to the hospital. Vivid picture of the casts ans white bandages ans unkept long dishwater blonde hair. She was sturdy but not overweight. A low income kid, which would have been typical of the patients we dealt with although I didn't work with kids that often.  2. I was at my parents' house (but nothing like my parents' house. I was there because I was going to attend a class reunion. I picked out a dress to wear- lots of specific derails about the look of the dress and the small flower print. Right down to the aquamarine pendant I was wearing. However, I kept looking thru several closets for a black short sleeved sweater or vests to wear on top, to dress it up. I knew what I had had, but couldn't find either. Kept going back to check to make sure I hadn't overlooked them, that they weren't under some other piece of clothing on a hangar. Gave up and then started looking for an appropriate coat. I discovered a white jacket with fur trimmed hood that I had worn to work in 1978 when I worked for WPAFB. I had looked fabulous in it, per my coworkers back then. Since I've lost weight during quarantine, I realized I could wear it again. It was probably more than I needed for the weather, but figured it would be ok, although I thought I should probably had just worn my black nylon raincoat.  My father said I could use his car which was out across a rather muddy parking lot. It was dark out and the lot had a few lights. There were 4 or 5 vehicles spaced widely in the lot and I knew it wasn't the pickup truck. I started heading towards one end with several vehicles, not sure what their car looked like anymore. My Dad called from the building doorway ( I now think it's an apartment building) that the car is in the other direction. I shout back that I know, even though I hadn't, that I had just been checking something out, and head uphill in the lot to where their car was parked by itself. Then starts a series of incidents where I become later and later for the party. I know I am driving there but I don't recall what the problems were. Before zi woke up, It was down to arriving at the event with maybe only an hour left. I am thinking that many may have already left but maybe ai would still see a few people I knew or had known.    Self analysis: cars always symbolize ""life"" in my dreams. So, message to myself is that I may know where I want to get to, but I'm not ready. Which echoes the current chaos in our house. I have lots of projects started during quarantine, have indeed lost weight, but I'm not looking forward to having to socialize in person yet, although I know that when I do do, I generally enjoy being with others. But, right now, I really don't have a sense of where I am going and the ""car"" I'm driving isn't even mine. And being with my parents always was stressful for me. I also tend to be late. And, have said my husband and I would  be the last people to abandon quarantine. My husband's PC has just advised us to stay quarantined because of his many comorbidities and because of the unknowns with the variants. This was a stressful dream even tho I haven't been consciously aware I was stressed! ",,
7930L,"Multi dream fragements:  1.  Was in what was supposed to be a library. Big U shaped desk with a display rack in the middle of the room. Middle aged women working the desk. I gave them a list of what I was looking for and they brought the books to me. I had to pay for them. One way a very thin little book,, not worth the cost, but I pretended that didn't matter. That it was a gift for someone, but I think I made that up because I was embarrassed to admit it was a mistake. I was making small talk with the women. Trying to figure out what to do about the glasses.  2. Because I was actually there to get my glasses fixed. The left ear peace was skewed outward and I expected it to break. They said the optician was booked and I was trying to plead my case. I usually travel with backup glasses but didn't this time. Without glasses, I can't see, so the glasses are important to me. They were also a heavy brown tortoise shell color and the lenses were quite large. Not attractive glasses since I've worn rimless glasses for years.  3. I had volunteered to do an outing with kids- middle schoolers or teens. The woman at the desk had put my books in a plastic bag and I noticed she had also   put in a map or literature related to wherever I was supposed to be going, which is when it struck me that the commitment was that same day. It was not in my plans but Inwas going to struggle to fit it in and act as if it was ok.  4. No longer at the book place. There is an insect, looking like a large mosquito, but not a mosquito. It isn't moving and may be dead. It's on a pale yellow cotton blanket. Quite a lot of detail to this image. I am concerned that it is not really dead but resting and/or may recover if it had just been knocked down momentarily. Debating whether to smash it but concerned about leaving a spot on the blanket which isn't mine. Someone says this insect is what they've been looking for and destroying. This is followed by an image of young black children, wading in almost chin deep black, muddy swamp water, doing some kind of manual labor. I'm thinking this is Africa because when I question what's happening to these kids, I'm told this is the way it is. That they are the only ones small enough to get into the caves or mines to search for and eradicate these insects. They seem to be carrying large oval grey metal containers that they are holding up in front of them,  barely out of the water. It looks grim, the whole scene is grim and I know there is nothing I can do about the situation in the moment. It's cultural and will require change on a much larger scale.   5. I am in a different location and there is going to be a significant event- graduation party, milestone anniversary, something important. Something that requires a lot of input, time, effort and my presence to organize and pull off the event. But I am told I have volunteered to go on a group outing with teens or young teens again. First I think it's the quick 1-2 hour outing that I thought I was going on when it came up in   the ""library/bookstore"" dream. But, learn that this is an overnight, maybe whole weekend thing and nowhere close to wherever I am. I protest that I would never have signed up for it because the event has been in the works for a very long time and I would have known that I couldn't go on such an outing. Whoever, insists that I did commit. My next step is to ask if there are backup people they can contact or if they could give me a list of people and I will make the calls and plead my case. Trying to problem solve, with the sense that the others are not sympathetic or willing to let me out of the commitment I don't remember making. No conclusion to this ...  Self- analysis: Eyes: Inhave glaucoma and was due to see my eye doc this week. The appointment was cancelled due to covid19. The regular checks are to assure that the drops are working as this is a new drug and all the rest have failed, so far. The last check was positive. But, that can change at any time. Light sensitivity has been an issue and it is hard to see at times.  Re books and time commitments: There is much I want to get done before this quarantine ends. It is like it has been a gift of time and I am making slow but steady progress in getting my life back in order, taming the chaos, clutter in this house. So much to read and never enough time to get to it before the quarantine days. Had hoped to have time to read the many books around here but haven't begun.  My daughter has taken on raising her 2 year old step-grandson. Yesterday we discussed via messenger how well equipped she is- I had been a good role model. Volunteered as a scout leader, church youth group leader, etc.  Personally, I am behind in my social commitments- calls, texts, emails, letters, messenger messages. Feeling burdened by the social, yet so much I want to accomplish every day re the neglected house.",,

I was involved in a lot of house projects that I wanted to get back to and she wasn't wanting to end the conversation, while I kept trying to bring it to a close. Interpretation: She was a difficult, strange person. Died 3 years ago. Very mixed feelings about her death because her death, at the time, was due to a botched medical decision made by her daughter, on bad advice from a nurse. I need to get my med papers in order!  2. I was upstairs in a 3 bedroom house. Only 1 bedroom had an a/c, I was experimenting with ways to block off the stairway so that the a/c would cool all 3 rooms. Used Big swinging door from one bedroom to close off the stairs lit was snug with the stairs, but there was a 15 inch gap at the top.

I was driving with my husband in the car when I suddenly couldn't figure out the road, couldn't see it clearly. Pulled over to let him drive.

But in the dream, we are having deep conversations like we used to. I don't remember the topics however. Just that it was all very comforting, as it had been.  2. I am driving into a very modern shopping mall and someone (spouse perhaps) is telling me to turn on to a certain ramp. But I know where I need to turn and get irritated. I take a different ramp and it takes me to a parking lot at the mall's lower level. I explain that is where we will be spending our time and therefore save us a lot of walking.   So, I suppose the message to self is that ""I know where I'm going and how to get there. Don't tell me what to do.""Hmmmm...",,
7388L,"Multi dreams. Last one: Was visiting some place. Female friend or acquaintance. First I had a room to myself and they gave me a small, old tv with an antenna. Was able to get 1 station if I stood near the tv. I spent time trying to get other stations, playing around with the antenna but to no avail. The news was on saying there was a snowstorm coming in. They expected it to last specifically 36 hours and there would be lots of snow. I looked out the window and it had already started to snow., although there was already snow but the drive was shoveled. The house was uphill and the driveway got very wide at the top, leading to the garage. I commented about the shoveling that was going to have to be done, hoping that maybe they had a plow. But no, it was going to have to be hand shoveled and I also knew we all had bad backs. Besides the female friend, I think the other 2 people were her parents. Then, she and I were in another room and this had one large bed. Felt much more comfortable when I sat on the edge and I told her so. The beds we had slept in the night before were twins and quite uncomfortable, My side of this big bed was going to be up against a wall. The room was small and the bed took up most of the space. She was already in bed, reading a book. I told her I had switched books and why. We discussed our books. I had the sense that I didn't know this person all that well and I wasn't totally comfortable with the situation but would have to make the best of it since no one was going anywhere until the snowstorm was past.  Self analysis: Need to call a old friend today. She emailed saying she was having trouble with the quarantine. I am not and wonder how much we really have in common anymore. The same is true about a female cousin I had a lot of contact with last night. They are both avid readers. I wouldn't want to be quarantined with either. This seems obvious that being storm bound equaled being quarantined. ",,

I am giving each 3 presents. It seemed like all 3 were my kids, but I only ever have had 2. Someone tells me my son is very ill. His face is quite flushed, but when I check his forehead, it's not as hot as I expected. I decide he has a fever but not alarming. He was always prone to run high fevers that required putting him in the bath tub to cool him down. I give him 3 small unwrapped books, apologizing if they are now ""too young"" for him but that he might find at least one of them interesting. One gift is a fiber optic ""spray"" like branches, in glass jars. One is supposed to add water or some kind of fluid to the jar and it will cause the spray of fibers coming out of the top of the jar to glow in multiple colors.

217LA,"Multi:  1. At 10:00 I awoke when I dreamt a saw a woman shot in the chest with a large caliber bullet, leaving a huge wound. And she falls backwards, presumably dead. At this point I tell myself it's a dream and my legs are really bothering me, so I need to get up. But then, I am still dreaming because my husband says something to me. And I think that this is crazy because I am semi awake, intend to get up but still dreaming. (My RLS was really an issue and I was getting up.)  2. Sometime after 13:00, I have a series of dreams involving friends. In the final dream, my husband and I are back at home from having been away. We wake up in our bed and I feel relieved to be back in my own bed. My spouse wants to to cuddle but my legs feel so good that I don't want to move or change positions from being on my back, pillow underneath my knees. I see the sun shining on our polished wooden floor and relish in the space we have. We talk about how we didn't enjoy the new trend in restaurant#, to crowd people at smaller tables with uncomfortable chairs. Also,little appreciation for ""designed"" meals with high prices and chichi plates. That we missed the old days when we'd go out with friends and all of our kids and everyone would fit into big booths together. And the food was simpler.  We then get up and the cat is waiting outside the bedroom door, as usual, waiting to be fed. My husband opens a hall door that is a linen closet, thinking her food is in there. I simultaneously open the pantry closet which is where her food has always been kept and mentally roll my eyes because he still doesn't know where something's are kept. (This isn't true in real,life in terms of the cat, however.) I tease him about it.",,
22611S,"Multi:  1. I was catching up on delayed medical appointments. Went for a mammogram first. No problems. Then, went to my skin doctor, a very attractive guy who in real life, is my eye doctor. There is always a long wait and I'm chatting with the staff. There is a lot of commotion and moving around of equipment and furniture. The building is old, strange, nothing I've seen or been in in real life. I am thinking that because he is running so late, maybe I will cancel. The cyst on my neck that I was concerned about has diminished greatly and is probably nothing to worry about after all. But then, he is ready and starts to examine me in the waiting room. For my chest are! We're standing between 2 bamboo screens. Female staff are assisting. He is quite hyper. (Our previous real life dermatologist, not an attractive guy, was always hyper.) They then need me to remove my sweats pants and lay face down on an exam table to check my back half. The staff expresses concern about the lack of privacy but at my age, and having been in so many medical situations and hospitals, I am not phased by it all. I have lots is visual details about the space that I am in. I ask several times if they are remodeling in the other rooms but never get an answer. I also wonder if they are being forced out for some reason. I remove my sweats and underwear and he starts to check my back and finds areas that are concerning. I wasn't aware that I had an issue. He says what the diagnosis is, but I don't quite catch it, the staff is taking notes, I know, per standard procedure. It sounds semi serious. I am glad I stayed or I would never have suspected a problem on my back. He has the staff ""scrub"" the areas with little ""mop heads"" on sticks that were dipped in some chemical treatment. They tell me it might sting and that they will apply dressings afterwards. They leave to get the dressings. I am still face down on the table. The doctor, who has been rushing about and talking very rapidly, is clearly manic from my perspective. I muse that he is able to still make a good diagnosis while being clearly incompetent and barely functioning. He then tells me that he thinks he is going to pass out. I realize he has some idea of what is happening to him. He is panicky. There is another padded exam table parallel to mine, and he does pass out on it, face down. The women return and I tell them that he is in a manic state and needs help immediately. That perhaps he was on medication and stopped taking it or took too much of something. I am looking for my clothes. I have my tee shirt and jacket on, have my sweatpants in hand, but can't find my underwear. We look around  in the waiting room, but things are in such disorder that it's hard to know where they were put and why they weren't with the sweat pants. I conclude that I'll just put the sweatpants on.Meanwhile, I'm waiting for paramedics to arrive so I can explain what I saw, so hopefully he'll get the right assistance and blood work done more quickly,  2. I am in an old gymnasium type of place. There are kids learning to play some kind of basketball game. I am chatting with one, but I am standing on some designated court space. I didn't realize that the floor was marked off. A guy, who seems to be in charge, yells at me to get off and stop talking. Which I do but keep talking to the tween, asking about the game. There is also something about applying some kind of white stuff to the windows in a swirl or, circular pattern to create privacy. So people on the street couldn't stare in.  Self analysis: in real life, I have been informally helping many people with their mental health issues. It's what I am good at, although, if serious, I always encourage finding a working therapist. Privacy seems to be a theme here. When it's needed for others and when I do or don't need it for myself. ",,

23967S,"Multi.  Last: I am ""away"" somewhere. Perhaps England. In one part, I want to wash my hair. There isn't a shower but 2 bathtubs with an aisle in between them. in a small room, but well lit space. One tub had recently been used. There is water still in it. I don't have any shampoo or conditioner with me and see that there are 2 big white bottles left on the side of the used tub. The person isn't around to ask permission,  so I decided I'll have to use hers and begin filling the unused tub. I would have preferred a shower but that's not an option. It's hard to wash one's hair in a tub. My hair has gotten very  long during quarantine.  Next part: I am trying to make a phone call, to home, I think. I am outside some kind of store, like a quick stop. I am writing the numbers on my hand as I punch in each one so I'll know what numbers I have dialed so far. I think to myself that I've seen my spouse use this technique. Because, like an old phone, there is nothing telling me what numbers I've entered. I hit a wrong key, but can't find a way to correct it. Which means I have to start over. The numbers I've punched in, are showing up on a huge electronic board in the store that I can see thru the large plate glass Windows.There are 2 women in the store who are posting numbers, like is done for the lottery. But there is a slight delay factor.     Next: They are posting the number I am supposed to dial, but now, the last digits have changed. The number is quite long, maybe 15 digits. I'm guessing I'm in a foreign country because the first numbers are a combination of 1's and 0's. I know they are a country code. After multiple tries I give up on calling home and decide I'll try to call our grandson because I have his number memorized. A couple pull up to the curb parking spaces next to me and a heavy set woman gets out. I have a vivid recall for what she was wearing. And looks like. She is someone I know, but an acquaintance. She approaches me, has something she wants to tell me. I keep trying to dial, and she says she can see that I am busy and not listening to her and she'll catch me later and gets back in the car in a bit of a huff (she is the passenger) and they drive off. She was annoyed with me.   The new number starts out ok, but then come a string of 1's. The people in the store are posting the numbers and I can't quite see how many 1's there are. There is a glare. I am trying to count, but then can't tell how many I have already entered on the phone I am using. I am going to have to start over.But I get connected to someone and stay on to see who will answer the call in case I got it right.  I say hello, someone starts to respond...

A short, stocky person (just a haze of while and some yellow) was directing me and someone's else to distribute a huge pile of 45rpm records in white sleeves, that he was carrying in his/her? arms. The purpose for handing them out to the audience was to distract them from a late start to this person's lecture/speech. I asked what the topic or title was and knew the audience wasn't going to like it. Either for reasons of age group or education, it wasn't going to appeal or be approved. I didn't think the 45 rpm records would either, but didn't say anything.No idea why I was there. (As director of s psych institute many year ago, I hired speakers on a regular basis.

When we get to our room, there is a large puddle of water on the beige carpet in the middle of the room that has the bed off to one side. I assure her it's not a problem, that we can stay in the room. We go down the hallway to a side hallway that leads to the parking lot behind the hotel. There is a large, parked semi with open sides that has bundles of some kind of innovative water absorbing mats. I take a bundle and we head back to the room. I put them on the puddle, which they begin to absorb. I'm satisfied to see that they are taking care of the problem.  A woman and her young daughter, perhaps about 7, show up at the room, The mother is upset because she had an appointment with a neuropsych colleague of mine about her daughter's problems with RLS and he blew her off. I've been researching RLS (which I have), so I empathize with her and squat down and talk to the child. I explain what it feels like to me and ask if she experiences similar things and to tell me what it's like for her. I then say (it turns out we are at some kind of conference) that another colleague has a better understanding and her name is Linda...(I can picture this woman. I knew 30 years ago in real life but cannot recall a last name). I don't really believe Linda has much expertise in this area, that I probably know more,but that, at least she will be kind and that may be all this family needs for the moment. I only have an MA so I don't ""qualify"" as expert enough in anything, per the PhD's- something I've always resented.  I also tell the child there is a special wall with balls hidden in it and that you find the balls and squeeze them and it helps with RLS while one is staying at this hotel.. I take her to the courtyard area where there is a light colored orange wall composed of a pliable vinyl. I get behind the wall with 2 balls. The child feels the wall until she finds the 2 balls I am holding against it and starts to happily squeeze them. My theory is that she can't think about her RLS issues while she is searching for and squeezing the balls. After a few squeezes, I move them to another spot for her to find and we do this for awhile. Then they head out to meet up with Linda.  I am back in the room, figuring out what I'll wear to dinner, meetings and breakfast the next day, I am quite happy that I have 4 new tops to choose from and that I look good in all of them. All but one are hoodies, but in light weight fabrics and fabulously prints. One is dark blue with small white stars and another has a peachy colored swirl pattern in a silky fabric. Lots of color and detail in these tops.    At some point in the dream, I am talking to the obnoxious colleague about the child he blew off. I consciously stroke his ego, saying they were sent to him because he is considered so knowledgeable about RLS. He pouts that this is a conference and he shouldn't have to see patients. I suggest that he offer to set up an appointment  with them, back at our offices, if he runs into them again. Since, after all, he is such a leading expert.    Self analysis: interesting that my Mom is with me because she and I had a difficult (for me) relationship. I was always working at keeping her happy. (She died in 2007) but there doesn't seem to be the usual strain between us, although with the water on the floor in the room, I did have to reassure her it workbench an issue and quickly solve it.  Because I've had RLS since I was about 2, I have joined a research group on Facebook and my rheumatologists have done the right things, used the right meds, which keeps mine under control most of the time.  The 2 docs in the dream were really former colleagues but quite stereotypical of all docs- kind and concerned but not helpful, or knowledgeable but not kind or helpful. One has to keep trying until one finds the right person.  And then, there is my old resentment of my underpaid MA degree vs all of those PhD's I did all of that work for and made them look good when they were only reading what I had written for them. Obviously, I am still resentful. Take note you researchers reading this if you have read this far!",,

11076S,"Multiple snippets:  1. Cousin Joan was in 1st but have lost that dream. She lives in OH and we lived in a duplex as children.   2. Walking up steps over an overpass. 2 other younger women going in same direction. A very pretty girl with red hair, flustered, rushes up to join them. She's younger than them, guessing about 20, and I gather from the conversation that they all work together. Maybe in a restaurant. She is sharing some concern, unsure of herself, and they are encouraging her.  3. I was a member of a women's finance club (true in real life. Dissolved the club in 11/2018 because there were only 5 of us left) I am with the other women who want us to get back together and combine with another group. We always met in someone's house. I intend to tell them I'm not going to. I am thinking that they have not kept up with physical distancing and it will be impossible to do so in anyone's house. But will not tell them that. I do find the idea of a financial group pointless at our age and in today's world.   4. I am in a gift shop that has unique and interesting items. One is a painted metal sand pail with a lovely design, maybe seashells, and some kind of appropriate word or logo on it. I am thinking it will make a great Christmas present for my family members because whatever it says reference somehow, the quarantine and will be a great memory gift of this time in our lives. There are other interesting things, much to look at, and I want to keep exploring. There was lots of color and detail in the things around me.  Self-analysis: For the record, going back in this covid19 study, my dreams always have lots of color and details.My cousin, Joan, and I were the equivalent of sisters. There were no other girls in the family and we are only 8 months apart. She is the younger. We interact daily on Facebook. As adults, her life has not gone well, she is judgmental, needy, has few friends and always broke. Recently, contact has been limited to Facebook and messenger. Previously it had been hours long phone calls. She has stopped the phone calls, for some unknown reason, which is fine with me. But, I do wonder why. I suspect it's because she has pushed me for a reconciliation with my brother, who has serious mental issues and has been a danger to me in the past. I severed all ties but he lives 2 hours away and will always be a cause for concern. But, our current relationship is confusing and troubling, I believe.  Re the young girls, as a therapist I listened to people for a living and have always been an eavesdropper and paid attention to the unspoken details. I have concern for the red headed girl. She is very pretty and vulnerable and I am not sure that the others are truly her allies. She may represent my 21 year old granddaughter, who is struggling emotionally right now and isolated at home with her parents. She hasn't been with her boyfriend since the beginning of March, she has been mentally unstable, and if their relationship fails due to this quarantine, I think she will be in trouble. She says little in group chats and has noticeably gained weight. She is extremely bright, pretty, an extrovert, but I am seeing none of this. As a grandparent with a prickly daughter-in-law, there isn't much I can do. A worry.  Re pr√©sents: our immediate family all gather at our house for Xmas, we exchange many gifts and I shop all year round for unusual presents. We group video conference every Sunday night now and I am anticipating our next time in person, perhaps. Looking forward to better times.  The financial group. In real life, they have all joined up with another group as of a month ago. At least 3 of the 4 that I know, are extroverted and are not doing adequate physical distancing, imo. I've been asked to join them in the new group, have no interest in it, but do feel the social pressure with the stance I have taken. I think I am telling myself to stand my ground.",,

One was the vertical ladder which seemed a bit unstable. Next to it was a set of stairs which seemed more stable. I decided to go for the stairs which actually was a little unstable. We were finding it hard to reach the top. As we were climbing, one of my best friends began complaining about her GI module in med school because it wasn't taught well since we were studying from home (due to coronavirus). I said just watch the osmosis videos. At this time I was afraid that I would fall off the cliff because the stairs was quite unstable. I struggled to the top but we finally reached it safely. There was a huge curtain that covered the cliff. When we peaked at it, it showed that the seemingly unstable vertical stairs was the better choice because it was anchored more tightly on the ground.

There were two very young boys, about 2 years old, and a girl about 4 or 5. The boys we shooed away, but the girl got through. Steve said they were going to nosebleed us. I held her in my arms and she told me that her mom wasn't feeding her. I asked her, ""does your mommy love you?"" and she said yes. I asked if her mom tried to get her food and she said yes. So I imagined a non-abusive mother who was really struggling financially. While this was happening Steve had called the parents and the family's car pulled up in front of our house. I was surprised and a little angry that Steve had called them. It was a big family in the car: the older parents, their two daughters, and the daughters' boyfriends. The parents stayed in the car. I told the little girl, ""You can come back tomorrow, or anytime you want."" The family did not smile or talk as the babies went back to them. Steve called one of the young couples over to him. He told them something like make sure these kids get enough to eat. Then he called just the boyfriends over, but the girls came too. The boyfriends looked exactly the same. They had the same blond haircut and the same black plastic glasses frames and the same long black coat. Steve told them that he didn't text them back on purpose (they had both texted him and he hadn't responded). Steve said not to tell other people; that he hadn't texted back other people so if they mention it, don't let on that he had texted them back. Or something like that. They left, and Steve and I walked back into the house. I thought maybe we shouldn't have let the girl leave. I asked Steve what he meant by nosebleed earlier (I think he meant ""they're going to bleed us dry"") and he said it was a term that he picked up in one of his undergrad classes. Steve was convinced they were a corrupt family. As we walked up the big carpeted stairs, we heard faint piano music. Steve looked at me incredulously. I said I think it must be a cd playing. But we had just seen a movie where a character walked into a house and piano music was playing and it might have been a scary movie where the piano player was the killer. We walked up the stairs slowly and quietly. I looked up through the banister to the piano and saw two people. It was Chanel and Dakota. Chanel turned around to me and said hi. She had had our key from housesitting or something before, but we didn't expect her to let herself in again because we were back. She came up to me and said ""I could never play like this before bed."" It was like an excuse, like she had the opportunity to play before bed so she took it while we were out at the movie.

There was a magic remote that could transform any living thing into a Pokemon. There was an evil magician after the remote in the ocean, so I ran down the bleachers, jumped into the water and swam to try to get to the remote before the magician did. It had been picked up by an animal that had been transformed into a seel Pokemon. I was able to grab ahold of a shark Pokemon, that brought me to the seel and the remote before the magician. Just as the magician was nearing, I pressed the remote and it wouldn't work. I threw the remote in the air, it turned the seel Pokemon into a Wingul, a seagull Pokemon, that flew up the hill, holding the remote. I was relieved it was out of the magician's hand but the remote fell into a couple that was clearly in an abusive relationship, that my brother's girlfriend was studying. Earlier in the dream I had talked to my brother's girlfriend about their relationship as she was studying psychology and rape victims and how to help. I got to the couple and could see the magician chasing me in the bleachers below. The couple had a baby that was playing with the remote, it turned itself into a bird, the father got mad and smashed the bird/baby into the wall and the magic was broken.

So I was debating if I could go part time at work. And also I don't actually ever want to run a bed and breakfast so I was having troubles justifying the purchase. I just loved the house. ,,

All of those bathrooms were weird, off kilter with narrow different sized slick comical looking by barely navigable stairs. Looking at one of the bathrooms I thought I would fall into the void if I used it as it was perched over precipice at an outward canting angle with very slick surfaces.     After using another bathroom set down in a ""hole"" I found that I had lost track of my mask, wallet and papers that I needed for the seminar adding to the discomfort I felt overall of being out of place, surrounded by too many people.     I washed up and finally located my things on a counter by the stairway back down to the main floor. When I returned to the seminar group, one of the instructors bullied me and insisted that I wanted to try on ""Ethan Allen's"" burgundy coat that was hanging on the group coat rack which was really weird because it was quite small and looked like a very young woman's coat.

There was a kid who was supposed to be king/in charge of a place and he had to make a speech and get through different trials in order to take this position. There were two older siblings who were adopted in and not eligible for the trials; but they still felt very loved and were not worried or jealous of the biological child. There was an old man who guided the child and gave him advice (a very ""Dumbeldore"" figure). I was also trying to give advice to the child; at the end of the tasks he was supposed to give a speech and I was giving him advice on how to appear confident. One of my highschool friends who works in theater also weighed in with advice, even though I haven't talked to this friend in a year. His input was a quote that consisted of something-or-other about oats. I cannot remember the analogy; but of course it made sense at the time (even if it was actually nonsense). The old man gave the child hints he needed to succeed and gain respect from other high-ranking officials. For example, the old man gave the child a code word, and led him through different rituals. The high ranking officials were definitely not pleased a child was going to take over; and they ept alluding to someone who had vied for power that ended up being exiled (in an attempt to rattle the childs resolve). At the end of this conversation lots of focus was given to closing up a regular brown shipping box with clear shipping tape. No idea why; maybe I'm ordering too many things off Amazon. The child was also given clues about how to succeed in the trials; e.g. that arrows that would guide the child through the maze were located on the wings of the butterflies that were in the maze.

In the beginning of the dream, my friend is in a very large and crowded kitchen I'of adults who I didn't know. My friend was dressed in pretty flannel pajamas. As the dream progresses I see her in various rooms cleaning the sizable clutter. I was aware that I never offered to help. Later, because she was nowhere to be found, I was searching the entire house for her. The number of bedrooms and staircases seemed to continue to increase, and there were children and pets in most of the rooms. In one, there was a very large and beautiful duck. The search for my friend went on for a long time until I finally found her back in the crowded kitchen. She now was wearing many layers of heavy clothing, the outside layer being a coat. She appeared to have aged greatly and collapsed in a corner of the crowed room. No one was helping her. A man who was lying on a daybed who certainly didn't look like her husband said not to worry about her because she was probably pregnant.  The dream ended there.      ",,

In another dream, I was in a public restroom and there was another woman in there who had plugged and iron in before going into the stall, and I didn't notice it and leaned into it while washing my hands and scalded my favorite sweatshirt. When I backed away I noticed it was also touching a curtain, so I unplugged it and When the woman came out I told her to wait until she was ready to use it to plug it in so she didn't start a fire. She yelled at me that she needs it very hot, and plugged it back in. Then I noticed a basket of complimentary travel sized lip glosses, so I took one as I was leaving. As I was walking down the street, I noticed a bouquet of strawberries (like a rose bouquet, but instead of flowers at the tops there were strawberries) lying in the road. I picked them up and noticed they'd been driven over, so I threw them back into the road. Then I somehow wound up in a college dorm in NYC with my kids.

He bought me an entire wardrobe of new clothing and paid exorbitant sums for lunch and then for dinner.  At face value, none of these benevolent actions fits his persona.  Therefore, the entire time he was giving I was waiting to learn what he inevitably would steal from me.  It was an incredibly tense dream, mostly because I knew no kindness existed inside him.  I kept thinking if he was flagrantly cruel, the blow would be over.  During the dream, I continued to anticipate the stab of his cold knife.   Right before awakening, we found a set of low seats at a low table along an indoor fake river bordered by astroturf to sit down for dinner.  I marveled how the students persisted to populate the scene, despite the closure of physical school.    As I swept the room, I noticed our (now dead) cat Wallace was seated on a lounger next to us with no leash or jacket.  I suddenly realized my husband would leave me stranded here, take all the clothing, give them to my once-best friend; and I had no way to keep poor Wallace safe as I figured out a way home for us.",,

The location of this place and its facilities has shown up in my dreams before, but it is not a location in the real world.  ",,

14796S,"My family and I were driving to the mountains to visit my grandparents. As we were passing a small town, I caught a glimpse of two guys on a cattle drive. Their horses were beautiful and one of the guys had blond ish red hair under a tan hat. We passed by all the cows and I took forever. Next thing I know I'm in school and I hate it. There was a group of three girls (known cleverly as The Three) and they hated me more than I hated school. I used to be best friends with two of The Three, but when their predecessors graduated they took their place. They constantly teased me about not having friends. I just wanted to leave. Somehow I managed to find a date to the student opera, and it was my boyfriend, but even that backfired somehow. I was mad at everyone. My sister decided to take me out to the movies with her friends, so we took the family 1996 Saturn and left late at night. When we got there, the two cowboys we passed on the way to the mountains were there. Their names were Colt and Casey. They weren't wearing their work clothes. The blond ish guy looked so happy to see me, and I enjoyed talking to him. We sat next to each other at the movie and when it was over we talked and talked. They gave us rides home in their trucks. The blond one invited me to play video games over at his house, and I said maybe later. Once I was home I realized that somehow we had swapped cars, I had Colt's truck and he had the family car. It was around midnight but I couldn't keep the truck for some reason. I got it and adjusted the seat as much as I could, but I still felt too small for the truck. I drove the 20 minutes in the pitch black to the address they gave me. They lived in a house not too far from where my dad grew up. I tried parking the truck and did a horrible job. Colt came out and started laughing. I told him that if it was so funny to him, he could try parking it. He told me to get out and he drove way out to the barn and parked it outside. I was miffed that he laughed at me when he could have told me to just park it where there was a ton of room. He apologized sincerely and once again offered to play video games. Since I was there I agreed. We went behind the house to a two story shed and when we opened the door a large open space stretched out before us. There wasn't a lick of furniture. Colt stepped sideways and apparently through the left wall. I stumbled around surprised. He poked his head out and smiled before coming out and showing me how to walk through the truck door. I asked why they had a door like that and he explained that his mom was a top agriculturalist and needed privacy and safety for her research. We climbed up some stairs in a narrow wall and finally reached a cozy room with pillows and stream lights. His mom's desk was covered in papers and a laptop was propped open. In front of her desk was another desk with a large monitor and two controllers and the two most uncomfortable desk chairs. Colt's younger brother Clay sat playing a game. Colt was about to force Clay to leave, but I remembered all the times my brother let me play video games with him and his friends, so I told Clay to stay. We played games long into the night. I have no idea what the game was, but it was exciting and worth it. Colt seemed happy I liked the game as much as he did. He told me I was his ""dream girl"", and I said I couldn't be because I had a boyfriend. Before he fell asleep at the desk Colt said he would wait for me on the ranch until I was ready. I fell asleep too. When I woke up in the dream, the mom was sitting behind us at her desk. Colt and Clay were still asleep. I got up to leave and the mom smiled and said she liked me. I thanked her and went down the stairs and out the shed. As soon as the door opened I was jumped on by a bunch of dogs. Only they were my sister's dogs. I gave them lots of pets and love and asked them where my sister was. They ran over to the front of the house and my sister was standing by the Saturn with her arms crossed. She said she was worried sick. I felt horrible for making her worry and I begged her to take us home before it got too late. She said it was already too late. Rolled my eyes at her and got in the car. She drove me to my boyfriend's house where he was waiting for me on the roof. I climbed up to talk to him. He said he was worried about me too and he had been tracking me all night. I told him where I had been and who I had been hanging out with and how Colt told me I was his dream girl. My boyfriend seemed unhappy but didn't say anything else. My cousin and brother pulled up in a jeep below us and honked the horn at me. There was a Gatling gun in the back and my cousin was manning it. They yelled to me that it was time to go. I looked at my boyfriend for reassurance and he smiled at me, gave me a hug, and said ""good luck with the war"". I jumped from the roof onto the jeep and my brother took off. While the jeep was speeding down the road my cousin handed me a gun and a sword. He had war paint on. I strapped myself into the jeep so I wouldn't go flying. We were in a jungle and driving over boulders. We finally reached our destination, a cavern with a large waterfall inside. We were to defend the cavern from the fairies. We had been at war with the fairies since before we could remember and my brother, cousin, and I were the leading generals. ",,

The girl also lived in the bunker and we were in a school club together. I went on a walk and talked about it with an older man who had mentored our club, then went to my family's bunker unit and chopped a lot of vegetables and prepared ingredients for a meal to eat with my family in the kitchen.

Perhaps the plane will be half full, or they will space passengers carefully throughout the plane. I want to go on this trip, as we have family in California. Husband explains that we will be on one of the first planes allowed to fly after travel restrictions have been lifted. I ask if he remembered my medication, because flying makes me anxious. Husband replies that he forgot it and apologizes. I spend a few moments considering how I'm going to navigate my anxiety. I ask husband if I have time to return home to get the medication before the plane leaves and he says yes- it's nine o'clock, plane leaves in three hours so I have time if I feel I need to run back and get medication.

May have been Christmas. Felt like I knew the house but not a place I am familiar with in real life. My kids are there somewhere. Young. Maybe grade school age. There is a phone call for me, on a regular house phone. When I answer it is one oof our best friends, Seth (married to Barb), who tells me they are in San Diego and Jim (my husband) wants to talk to me. Jim gets on the phone is is struggling to talk. I'm asking him why he's in San Diego (A place we went frequently when Jim was working on a Navy problem for his company.) He was supposed to be meeting me and the kids(wherever we are.) He is saying he can't and I am asking for reasons. He's not answering and I am throwing out guesses. Is he leaving us, is he in some kind of trouble (like having to go into Witness Protection), is he going to Mexico, is there another woman, etc.etc. He is crying softly but not answering. I'm distraught. At which point I wake up in a panic.  Self analysis: I don't know that Barb is with Jim and Seth. I had made an assumption when Seth said ""we.""  In reality, Seth is dead. Has been dead for about 5 years. From cancer treatments gone wrong. Jim, too, has had 2 bouts of cancer and has taken meds that almost killed him. We are still in self-quarantine because I fear more for Jim's safety than my own. He picks up viruses very easily and was sick for 2 months with something like Covid19 last fall. Perhaps it was. I think in this dream, Jim was with Seth because he had died. I think it was all tied in with my Covid19 fears and worries about keeping him safe. I've cancelled medical appointments because I don't want to risk bringing anything home to him. Some friends think we're being too cautious, but  we're not giving in to peer pressure. Yet...At ages 73 and 75 our mortality weighs heavily on me at times. The realization that our years are numbered and which one of us will die first. This dream will stay with me for a long time now. Quite unexpected when I feel content with our dailY lives and the gift of this time together, with just each other, no distractions.",,

I went in for my turn and there was a small, long, narrow room, brightly lit with minimal decor or furniture . One whole side was taken up by a large bed. The doorway to the room was in the middle. A stocky, unattractive Asian, shirtless man was sitting bolt upright  on the bed, back to the door with a fluffy white cotton comforter pulled up to his waist, covering his legs and lower body. The mattress took up that whole side of the room, wall to wall. No head or footboard. I got on to my side of the bed, to the left side of the man, with my clothes on, confused by the situation. I pulled up the comforter and sat up straight like the man. I put my right hand down for support and felt something soft and squishy. When I looked under the top of the comforter, it looked like rabbit droppings. Raising the blanket more, I saw 3 full grown, live, bright yellow ducks lined up in vertical row. The droppings were theirs. I didn't know what to make of the situation or what was going to happen or what the treatment was going to be.    Self analysis: My first thought was that it was about getting ""my ducks in a row"" which makes me laugh, if that was the message. We have been treating quarantine like an extended vacation- lots of reading and movies and leisurely discussions because we don't have to go to appointments and have no demanding social commitments. However, there is much work to be done in this house, both paperwork and physical work. Which we are neglecting.  Our son has been heavily involved In meditation and just completed a 7 day retreat, with much upright sitting. Which he said was very hard on his back. We also have a Chinese acupuncturist that we have not been able to see since quarantine began. Perhaps the other part of the message to myself was to ""watch out for shit"" because I think our son has gone overboard on the things he gets involved in, as if this new yoga/meditation guru had all of the answers. Not that I would tell him that. And figuring out how to safely resume sessions in the future.",,
2983S,"My husband and I had to go somewhere for some reason (?).  We ended up in a house next to a family we know.  In real life this family has had Covid-19.  The wife had it first, then the husband and now their son does and he's a friend of our son's.  We were renting a house next to theirs and my husband thought it would be good to visit them and say hello.  I told him that I didn't think it was smart and that they could still be contagious.  He wasn't really worried and not paying attention to what I was saying.  When we got in their house and were in the living room I felt really uncomfortable.  The couple excused themselves for a minute and went in the other room.  I told my husband I didn't feel safe and I was leaving. I went to the house we were staying in next door. Both homes were on hills.  To get to the one we were staying in you had to climb up a hill and part way up was an old set of stairs that were very narrow.  I had a hard time fitting through and went back over to the grass and climbed up the hill to the house.  Our son came and we went back to the friend's house to get my husband.  When we left we were saying how we didn't think it had been a good idea to visit the friends.  We were leaving their house and the stairs were almost like a fire escape or parking garage metal stairwell.  He was above us and when we expressed our concern...he was above us and spit down at us because he was angry.  I kept telling him to stop but he kept doing it.  This dream was strange because my husband is very safe and cautious about this pandemic.",,
4902S,"My husband and I invest in houses we rent out, and I dreamt about one of the most recent houses we bought.  I dreamt that my husband was letting the former owner keep her things in the house even though she was not staying, which would mean his father (our property manager) would have to clean it all out, which I thought was unfair to him.  His father agreed.  Then the next thing I knew I was running from him in Africa where I didn't think he could find me, and I found myself in a white upper class neighborhood of an otherwise poor country and eating at Israeli chef Ottolenghi's restaurant, but after the meal was over, I was talking to a young couple who told me the other of his two restaurants was better, so I was disappointed.",,

I started looking over the books and was startled to find some of my own volumes on the shelves -- not only printed books I recognized, but at three volumes of the diary I kept when I was a teenager. I found an employee and explained the situation, telling him I wanted to issue a formal request to have at least the diaries returned to me. He went to get his boss, and when she arrived I started telling her the same thing. She seemed impatient and said we could deal with that later, but she was glad I was here, because she wanted to show me something. She sat down at a table with three other people and started running a D&D game. Now I was getting impatient because my husband had gone off to look at the gallery exhibits and was probably almost done, and I was afraid I was running out of time to see them myself. But I didn't want to leave before I had made my request to have the diaries returned. I was even willing to offer them back to the institution upon my death; I just wanted the volumes for so long as I was alive, because they were my memories. ",,

Fast forward a few days, it was our last night of the trip. My husband and I threw a big college style party in the vacation house. The next morning we had the kind of clean up you see in movies where there's just garbage and empty drinks everywhere. My family's house was all ready to check-out so they came to help us clean. We had to get all of the sheets and towels into the laundry before we left, and make the beds with clean sheets.

We threw the doll down into the basement and then through a crack in the door...I could see the doll had turned into a small child and was walking around down there.  I looked again and the small child was on the railing climbing up hanging upside down from it.  At one point I went down there.  The doll/child was gone but I was still nervous thinking it would reappear.  It was a fully open basement with a concrete floor , some small windows near the ground and a couple doors that led outside.  As I was walking around I noticed there were some boxes of items left behind by previous owner and some other things.  It was pretty open and clean though.  ",,

21117S,"My husband and I were with one of our daughter's high school friends in Nisakyuna, NY, who is also a Facebook friend of mine. No idea why we were together. She is a yoga teacher and lives  in Vermont. I haven't seen her in person since 1986. We were driving and it must have been in Niskayuna, because we were flagged down by 2 couples who were acquaintances thru a long time friend (since 1969). This friend, John, was in the driver's seat of a car, presumably his. There was a car in front of him and one behind on a non busy 4 lane boulevard. The women were in the passenger seats and the husbands were the ones stopping us. Seems we knew them, but I don't really know who they were. We were our current ages. They were trying to get John to an ER for a psych admit. They wanted us to drive behind his car while one drove along  side and the other in front, preventing him from going anywhere else. They had not been able to get him out of his car.     Background history: In the past, when his wife, my best friend, died, I stayed up all night with him, talking him out of suicide, with his gun in his hand all night. And then another 2 days thru the funeral with him before I felt he was stable. So, John has a history of instability, is I'm his 80s, probably has some dementia and has always been rather self-centered and waited on by his family. On the other hand, he's financially supported his grown kids and grandkids because they've had serious health issues.     I have been doing informal therapy/counseling with some 20-75 year old friends and family members, mostly over election fears but also some serious health issues during the last few months but escalating last week. I have always seen Jen as  a very stable person, as is my spouse, although his health issues and the election have had him discouraged and depressed right now.

The gowns were made of things like deep purple velvet or gold colour changing taffeta - and they were all in my size. I couldn't buy one that day, but I bought some other things and resolved to come back.    Later I dreamt my grandmother (the one I hate) was serving a big glass pot of meat broth in her living room.

I hopped off and made my way to go to the restroom in the building. Someone pointed me in it's direction, one floor up. There were a few unknown men and a lady inside. I wondered why she was there. Anyway, I used the restroom to pee and made my way to the bus. I realised that the second bus too had arrived. Shortly we were on our way again. ",,

I've been dreaming of similar things for the last few months. About buying things that seemed right at first but after a while, were not that right.",,
27662S,"My wife and I were in a house similar to my parent's house while I was a child. My grandmother, who used to live with us during those times and died 40 years ago was there also. My wife urged me to go somewhere important in the dream so I was about to change my clothes when I felt I had to poop. My grandmother went to the bathroom before me and when she went out she somehow stained the walls near the door. I proceeded to clean the walls, very disgusted, but had to do it. My wife told me to stop cleaning, but I said I couldn't let the walls be so dirty. I was half-dressed, nude from the waist down but with a fancy shirt. My wife insisted I shouldn't be like that but I told her I would dress completely once everything was clean because it's absurd to clean while fully dressed. Once everything was pristine, we went to an office where I had to fill some papers. A woman gave me a paper where I should put my name and other data. She went to give that same paper to a lot of other people in that room like it was a classroom and that was an exam. I noticed that my paper was the wrong one because of the instructions she was giving to everybody on how to fill the blanks, which made no sense looking at what questions figured out in my paper. I took other people's papers and compared them to mine and mine was different. I protested but the woman didn't pay any attention to me so I got up and went to one of the offices in front of us and got the right paper. I showed it to my wife saying see? that's now the right paper. I remember writing down my name and other data on that paper. That's the second time I dream about dirty bathrooms and office papers.",,
9989L,My wife and I were in some kind of huge never ending apartment. There was a massive party where everyone was getting married. There were brides and grooms everywhere and there was strobe lighting and an intense DJ. Brides and grooms were passed out on tables. There were also cribs for babies with webcams and gawkers and happy parents showing off their babies. The parents were also in tuxes and wedding dresses. The babies were unbothered by the music. At one point I was on an escalator. I think we entered the party through a mall?,,
23504L,"My wife and I were in the car when we saw Virginia, an old ex-friend of mine in the street, we stopped for a moment to tell her to wait for us so we could talk. My wife never met this woman in real life, but in the dream, it seemed like she knew her. We had to keep driving, we were blocking the street, so we searched for a place to park the car and then went to a restaurant nearby. I thought ""how can we tell Virginia we are here?"", but my wife was talking to the head waiter, in a very expensive and empty restaurant like we were expected there and the place was empty for us. Virginia arrived, so now it was clear that my wife had arranged to hole thing for me to talk to my ex-friend. I was half furious, half glad that we could possibly cure the old wound, so I advanced my hand towards her but she rejected me. I felt very hurt because in my mind it was her who hurt me in the first place, years ago when she refused to come to visit with my other friends me when I was recovering at home after almost dying. I stopped talking to her after that day, and she never called, so I completely erased her from my life. Years after that I knew from a common friend that her husband had brain cancer and my friend suggested calling her, but I said that she was no longer my friend, so I had no reason to call her. She was furious and I said why has she come if she hated me, but she said I had the obligation to apologize. You apologize first! I shouted. I don't recall anything more.   Later I dreamt I was having fun with some friends and we all were much younger than in real life. I was having some drinks in a tattoo parlor and things got a little out of hand, so while we were talking my whole right arm and hand, including my palm, was covered in very small colorful tattoos, all already cured. I had to go home and the people I encountered in the streets said to me that the tattoos were strange and ugly but I said I liked them. It was not true, but what could I do?   ",,

20301L,"My wife and I were visiting friends in Upstate NY where we used to live. We were staying in a resort hotel on a lake and we had our cat with us. We left our room by a back exit to some stairs on the outside of the building that had a small entry room between the main hotel room and the stairs with doors at either end. As we exited, the cat ended up in this small area and we left here there. As we were talking with our friends, we decided to go out for the day and I realized I needed to get the cat back into the main room so she would have water and food. I went back into the hotel by the main entrance and proceeded to the elevators to go to the floor for our room. The hall by the elevators was poorly lit so it was hard to decide which of a large bank of elevators to take. The first elevator I got in ended up to be a car that went under the water in a path under the lake and then back to the hotel. When I got back to the hotel, I entered a second elevator and it took me up in the air along the lake ot connect to a group of condos and it gave a great view of all of the surrounding area. I remember thinking that I needed to recommend that everyone try this elevator before we left. Unfortunately for the cat, I woke up before I got back to the hotel to get the correct elevator to rescue her.  ",,

We were in Florida (but nowhere I've actually been; my parents, brother, and I were supposed to fly to Florida tomorrow for a family vacation that was cancelled by the pandemic),and our immediate family of four walked down a driveway (similar to that if the timeshare where we stay in Florida). It was my brother's wedding evening (I think with a planned sunset ceremony, though the bride and guests bad be we arrived), and we approached a table with a sign directing guests where to go, manned by the property caretaker (not the one who works there IRL), and someone told her the wedding was off. I watched two brown tabby cats on a small table and chair lick each other adorably (I like cats, but my dad, brother, and I are allergic to them; I've never seen cats and the timeshare before, but my friend I was supposed to take a day trip to visit on this Florida vacation has two cats, but they're orange). We ducked under the rope/small barricade, and for some reason my mom was trying to console my brother (who wasn't overly visibly upset) about his wedding by saying that she'd send him some nice steak/seafood/etc. To take home with him (on this annual family Florida trip we usually ear pretty well, including dining out about every other day, which isn't typical for us at home). When we went inside we were suddenly in this large, dark room with darker blue or green tiles walks and floors with two-story ceilings that felt like an underground place that seemed to be almost like something out of a forboding high school (not the one my brother and I attendee IRL). I flipped a huge switch that looked more reminiscent of something out of Frankenstein than a traditional light switch and illuminated a row of globe lights (like the ones in the hallway in the movie Parasite, except the light bulbs took a little bit of time to reach their full brightness), and then a second one that each slowly showed half of a long, dark, narrow swimming pool. I was thinking about what foodstuff order to place online for my brother and to make him feel better about his cancelled plans (when I messaged with him IRL two days ago, I confirmed that I wouldn't be visiting him in Germany (where he lives)/traveling in Scandinavia in the first two weeks of June due to the pandemic, and he confirmed that his week long Thailand vacation was also cancelled).

She was going to a Unitarian Universalist gathering/service and I feel obligated or am talked into going with her.  She makes a formal introduction to the people in the room saying I had been in the Schenectady congregation we onceo belonged to in the  '80's. We haven't been affiliated with any church since moving to the Boston area in '95.  A man says that, as a new person, it's customary to give a speech or deliver a sermon to the group (so they can assess me, I think) and small tan cards are on a small table in front of me with things I am supposed to talk about.   Aside from knowing that one can believe whatever one chooses, I no longer remember finer details, history, or tenets. I also hate public speaking. But, I stand up and start talking about our days in Schenectady. My husband and I both taught religious Ed classes and worked, especially with young teens ans teens. I recall our outings and challenges with the kids and the very memorable sermons of one outstanding minister we had, now deceased.   The off the cuff talk seems to satisfy them even though I didn't follow the cards, and the meeting or service concludes. I chat with various people as we are all getting ready to leave.

11926L,"Now I only can recall my last dream, yet there were several throughout the night.    I was temporarily living in Rome and had a male roommate from NY.  (Now that my research has determined major-urban real estate should decline in value by 67%, I realized Manhattan may no longer be beyond my grasp; so right before bed, I was looking at rental rules for landlords, encountering new rent-control laws as well as co-habiting companies and their issues.)    It was about to be his first subway experience after the pandemic disappeared; so I asked him how he thought the layout would change.  I already had seen the aftereffects.    At first, he refused to predict what he would see.  Then I became more annoyed as he rattled off social distancing measures, when I explicitly had asked him how the space would change in a non-protective way.  He refused to think about it and soon we were at the doorway.    What I wanted him to ponder was how the real estate inside this dark cavern would be allotted with more folks out of work.  I wanted him to predict work-from-home status & blossoming crime would lead still-employed people to reside outside Rome proper, which would lead to far fewer subway riders and more open kiosk space/fewer vendors.  That extra space would be secured by smart people as storage space for the existing vendors, allowing them to operate with less hassle of hiding/carting home their visible stock at the end of the night.    Once inside the building, my roommate became female & we see my best friend from the womb--our moms were pregnant together and friends, too--working with her brother & his family selling wine just inside the doorway.  I was shocked.  My friend Linda always has the most incredible jobs.   Presently, she works alongside an Israeli billionaire chemist & doctor, working on cancer drugs.  Those companies are sold, once the FDA likes the results and then they proceed to the next cancer killing idea.  Before that job, she was the grant writer for Sean Penn.  In other words, she works well with difficult. powerful people and here she is in a dark subway selling wine?  She seemed happy, though.  She was in Rome, at least.    It was great to see them again; since we normally live so far from one another.  I had a horrible time introducing my roommate Jodie to them.  We kept being jostled by the emerging subway riders.    Then I noticed no one was buying wine; yet they were buying cigarettes, candy, snacks, water, & convenience store items from the neighboring kiosk directly opposing the staircase leading up to street level from the subway cars.  I realized location is everything, as well as serving the immediate needs of your clientele; since there no longer were wine aficionadi left in Rome. These were ""essential workers"" left to rush back and forth to menial jobs.  Then I started musing how artists would be the next inhabitants of Rome and what they would need amidst the rubble...  That's all I can recall.",,

I realized it was a real person when it started to move toward people dressed in military uniforms - and it would shake their hand and say thank you for your service. Boy was it vivid. I then found myself on a train and it stopped at a station. I was with people who were familiar to me - I was so happy and comfortable with them, but they were not y family. When it stopped a young girl who I felt I was responsible for, though I do not know who she was, asked to get off to get a drink. We let her go and waited not he train with some other children and another adult (all who I knew but don't know) and the train started to move.

We are passing through an urban area, and as I look out the window I see a HEMA studio with brightly painted walls, each a different color. A few blocks later we pass another one, and I point it out to my companions.    Then I notice that a lot of people on the bus are wearing HEMA gear, including quilted gambesons and swords. I look closely at the swords to see if they are of familiar make, but although I do see a maker's mark, I don't recognize it. I am also wearing a gambeson, but I have no sword.     As our stop nears, my companions move to the front of the bus, preparing to get off. I start to follow, then realize I left a bunch of my stuff on the seat. I have two backpacks, a blanket, and a few shoulder bags, so that it is hard to carry them all, even though some are empty.     As I join my companions in the front seat, I wonder why I brought all this extra stuff. I guess I just wanted to save it. Would I really miss it if I lost it? Did I ever lose anything I really missed? I remember a stuffed animal of my mother's a lamb called ""Lambikins."" I was sad when it was lost, and my mother was sad when I told her about it. Maybe I shouldn't have brought it up. Some things make you sad to know, but if you hadn't been told, you might never have thought about it. But on reflection, I realized that my sadness was for the object itself: what had become of it? Was it still in the world somewhere, abandoned in a dump, mouldering away? Or had it already been wholly destroyed?     [NOTE: The first part of the dream seems like my mind nudging me to get back to HEMA practice, which I have been skipping since it went online and feel a bit bad about neglecting. But the last part of the dream might be a completely fabricated memory: so far as I'm aware, there was never a stuffed lamb called ""Lambikins"" in either mine or my mother's life.]   ",,

15042S,"Political prisoner or psych ward or both. Whole city dominated by a cult. [Day residue: Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, half-watched last night.] One particular warden/orderly, an older woman, disliked me. I sat at a table pretending to read a book while pointedly ignoring her, and this got me into trouble. She pulled the book away from me, and I, still determined to ignore her, pretended that I couldn't understand why it was moving.     I walked out of the building, wanting to find a place to hide. I found a flag in front of another building and hid behind its fabric. I held very still because I heard people passing by, but the wind was blowing, and I was afraid my right foot would show under the edge of the fabric. I was wearing sandals. I moved my foot as far out of sight as possible, but the wind might still reveal my contours under the flag's fabric as it blew it against me.     Sure enough, two male orderlies appeared to discover me. I moved from my hiding place and entered the building, which turned out to be a big open church. There was no place to hide so I tried to walk out, but the two orderlies intercepted me. They were gentle in manner, and I realized that they thought I was pregnant. I laughed harshly, asking, ""For that, wouldn't you have had to-"" and I scissored together the forefingers of my two hands. Obviously this was not the right gesture-I was deliberately feigning ignorance of the mechanics. I scowled as though realizing my gesture wasn't quite right, and modified it, doing the ""finger in the hole"" version, but using my thumb to make it look awkward, again as a deliberate ploy to feign ignorance. My fumblings seemed to convince the men that I was naive about the actual act, and amused them sufficiently that they did not pursue me too aggressively, and I managed to slip away again.     Earlier:  I was moving through the aisles of a sort of farmer's market/food warehouse. I stopped to buy a bag of carrots. [Day residue: last night making dinner I used my second-to-last carrot.] I took my time choosing, and in the end rearranged the contents of the bags to make my own assortment. I weighed it, but the weight did not match what was on the sticker of the bag, so I found a different bag with the right weight and put the sticker on the one I had made.     At some point:   I was a boy riding a bike down a paved road. It was two lanes with a divider, but the lanes were only wide enough for bicycles. Initially I got stuck behind another bicyclist going too slowly and had to perform a passing maneuver. Then I hurried on my way, but when I realized I was going to fast and tried to break, the inner lever of the right brake broke off in my hand. I kept hold of it and cautiously used the left break, aware that it could make me flip if I hit it too hard. [Note: I did this once in WL and will never forget that lesson.] Riding the bike was much more difficult when I decided to take a shortcut across a grassy field to get to the train station. Crossing the tracks was even more complicated. Finally I got there, and the train had just stopped, so I needed to decide if I should try to buy a ticket for the current train (which might leave at any second) or err on the side of caution and buy a ticket for the train that would come in 20 minutes. I was leaning toward the latter when I awoke from this sleep period.     Later:   I had found a trove of wonderful handmade books. I opened one, which was beautifully leather bound, and found that it contained a separate leather bound book sandwiched inside the double-binding of the outer book. (By ""double-binding,"" I mean that there were two separate page-blocks, with enough space between them on the spine to accommodate the inner book.)    The pages were all hand-written in beautiful lettering, sometimes formal calligraphy, and interspersed with full-color hand-drawn illustrations. I recognized the book: it was one of my old dream journals. As I flipped through the pages, some of the entries reminded me of particular dreams, while others failed to jog my memory.     At one point, I was rapidly scanning a paragraph when I thought I saw the word ""covid-19."" I started shrieking in alarm and excitement. My husband and some other guy (vague DC) burst into the room. I pointed to the paragraph: I had written this ten years ago, before the word even existed... where had it come from? But when I looked again, I saw that I had misread, the paragraph said something innocuous and completely different. I sheepishly admitted my mistake.     Just before the last dream:  There was a massive old gnarled tree that inspired reverence in me. Even as I gazed at the thick trunk and branches rising overhead, I could feel the presence of the root system under my feet.   ",,

One dinner is set around the holidays. People are eating and I realize we need some sharper knives for the meat, so I walk around the table giving everyone a steak knife. Then I realize I forgot to include napkins and that's how I know it Christmas because I give everyone a paper holiday napkin.  In another mealll, but the same setting, the plates are all covered with something in the shape of a pup tent. Might be fabric or paper. Dark colored. The opening faces each person. I can't see what's on the plates and no one removes them while they are eating. I am guessing it's to keep the food warm.  In one of these dreams, my Dad stands up after finishing and says we need a better rug. It's a thin, patterned oriental that has a thin, non slip pad underneath. But the rug isn't laying flat and when a chair is moved, it doesn't move easily and the rug bunches up. I comment that I just need to get a thicker, proper pad for it. I like the rug design, want to keep it, but I can see that it is a problem and a trip hazard.  In another of these dinner dreams, we've purchased some sort of large key board for our son, who does play multiple instruments. It's in 2 long, maybe 6 ft, pieces that are in dark leather padded cases. The pieces are meant to be place next to each other to form the whole keyboard. I think the top section is the electronics, for producing different accompanying sounds, like other instruments.  We clear a section of the table so he can put the pieces on it. But that's as far as that goes.  The house/room isn't the one I live in. There are only chairs and the table and maybe a sideboard in the room. So, I do not know for certain where we are. Definitely not a house or room I recognize in real life.  Aside from my Dad's critical comment, I don't know that anyone is happy. Dinners with family could be tense because my mother-in-law, a widow, was never happy. My mom, was also often unhappy with me, just because, so I was always trying to please. Not giving everyone sharp knives and a napkin was a real error on my part. And then realizing the meat wasn't tender was another issue because the elders would have trouble since they all wore dentures. These dreams were 3 separate dinners, same room, and 3 in a row.",,

The event ended at 5am so when I heard everyone waking up I woke up, hid the tablecloth and was trying to sneak away so noone saw me but I couldn't find my shoes.     The second dream was about the WNBA draft which happened last night.

I think we had bags in an overhead rack towards the back. There are at least 2 people that have fallen over, asleep, each taking up 2 seats. One woman's head and upper torso are out in the aisle. Otherwise, all other seats are occupied except for the ones across the woman in the aisle.  I retrieve a bag with 2 donuts and sit down in the empty seats across deodorant, the oddly positioned woman. I motion for Jim to join me to eat his donut. Mine is chocolate covered and his is very large, pretzel Hale's and has a sugar coating, I think they are very good and surprisingly not greasy.  After finishing my donut, I try to rouse the woman and get her to reposition herself on the 2 seats she has, without her upper half being out in the aisle.  Self analysis: in my dream world, being in a car or bus always represents my life. In this case, my husband and I are on some unknown journey together, not in charge of the destination or journey. Others are around but no one is helping the strange woman who may be ill or drunk or drugged. No one else has helped her, so I do what I can without getting overly involved. Just try to make her a bit safer. Similar to how we are dealing with family and friends and neighbors who are out and about these days, while we stay in quarantine.  As for the donuts, they are favorite treats when we travel. Our usual breakfast with coffee from Dunkin. Haven't had one in 10 months!

Later, I finally was invited by my husband to visit the apartment (for which I pay half) where he now lives.  In reality, I've never seen it.

Our cat sitter Blake arrived to take my husband to the airport.

Suddenly, I'm sitting at an old friend's sparse apartment and asking him how his life has changed as a pirate of published works.  In real life, he helped invent the RealPlayer so never needs to work again.  He told me it's the same as 2003.

I followed him in. Our kindergarten friend¬†went into the first row but then he climbed over into our row.

One day as I was walking¬†through the building where he worked I finally acknowledged him and said ""bye,"" and called him a nickname (I forget what it was). He said what? I repeated it. He came over to me and I put my arm around his hips (he was very tall). He gave me an earring, which he was helping me put in my ear. It wasn't going through because my hole had closed up a little. I took the earring and pushed it through. There was a little blood. He gave me an alcohol swab. I said you can do it again. He came very close to my face and put his arm around my head, caressing it a little, to meet his other hand at my ear. It felt nice. I thought if he kissed me it would feel nice. He finished putting the earring in and it was very long, like a necklace. The back wasn't on properly so I fixed it in place. The earring played a song I didn't like and I had trouble not looking like I hated it. Later I was outside in a garden. Both our cats were there and they both barfed. I was looking at a plant and trying to figure out how old this guy was. He was a billionaire and I thought he must be in his 40s or 50s even though he looked very young. There were other men who wanted me too. One had a startup and made millions of dollars and had always wanted to be with Bjork since he was young (I was Bjork now?). Jake came over and I talked to Jake about whether to date this older person. Then Jake turned into my mom and we were in a kitchen. I said he's 51 years old. And she said No!

I am sewing something, doing a repair, and I have 3 kids sitting on the floor in front of a TV, couch at their backs, watching an old movie I wanted them to see. It should have had talking because it was a '50s movie but was a silent one instead. One early teen was my daughter and one was a boy who had been a close friend of my son. They seemed to be enjoying the movie.    The next, I am in a store where my son is working, looking at a clever toy/fiddler that involves heavy rubber tubes, a paddle board, colorful beads...  I am thinking it will make a great Christmas gift. Below is a description of the store.    Driving a car with others in it on our way to a small town where our son was working at a country store kind of place.   We were passing a long row of huge barns and houses under construction by Amish farmers who had decided to reportedly set up some kind of business venture. No one was working on them and it was mostly the framing that was up, There was little space between them, which isn't typically the Amish way of doing things. It was late in the day...the light was fading, the structures were all on land that raises up above the road. But, like a typical Midwest scenario, the land was open, not treed, like New England.  We arrive in the small town. The building is set off by itself, as if it had been a gas station/quick stop and has gravel parking on all sides. 2 roads come together at a point, making the piece of land triangular. We enter  the shop with the intention to order something to eat at the food counter and also to buy a novelty item that they sold. My son wasn't there and the elderly owner said he'd call him to come back from wherever he had been sent. There were no other customers. And the things I wanted to buy, which had been hanging on a display that was just above head height, weren't there anymore.  My son arrives, gets out of his car and is looking around, as if he's not sure what's going on. I realize we've parked on the other side of the building and he can't see the car.    While the kids in the early part were early teens, my son, in all scenarios, is more likely in his 20's or early 30's.    Note: Not surprised about my kids being in my dreams since we had long calls with them on Wednesday night after putting our cat to sleep.  I am surprised that our sone's friend is in the one dream, because I haven't thought about him in years. We were living in Dayton, OH at that time, so the setting is correct for him, as is the landscape. Although I am not familiar with the town I am driving to or the roads.",,

I find a large Crayola art set lying in a few inches of water in one of the wide pebbly streams. [Day residue: yesterday brought home a box of things from my office, on top of which was a box of Crayola crayons and the molded plastic top for some other set of art supplies.] It contains an assortment of markers, bottles of ink, et cetera, and is about 2' x 3' in dimensions in length and width, but flat. I fish it out, thinking that probably a lot of the materials will be salvageable.      I also find a perfect pair of stud earrings with a pretty lavender stone. I think I found them in the stream initially, but later I am surprised to pull them out of my mouth. I feel other things in my mouth and pull out more earrings, then finally manage to get a grip on a large marble-like thing in the back left corner of my mouth. I pull out a bauble that it shaped like a skull. It has plaque or some other residue on it, and as I clean it off my tongue probes the empty area it left behind and realize that it had been embedded in my gum, and for a long time I had been unwittingly using it like a tooth. [Bleedthrough: I wore my nightguard to bed for the first time in a couple days, and that often leads to dreams where I feel weird things in my mouth that I try to pull out.]     Later, I was sitting outdoors on a grassy bank next to a brook, with two men. One was my father and one my butler. [Note: Obviously I have no butler in WL, and the character didn't remind me of anyone.] The two men are drinking a clear liquid like sake from organically shaped cups. [DR: last night I had a few sips of sake from a small handmade clay cup.] Meanwhile I am kneading and pinching a material in my hands into a large round cup-like shape. The material is like a very soft clay, but smooth and slick in texture, and has a wonderful opalescent play of varying dark colors. It feels very sensual to touch and mold.     My father asks if I remember how my grandmother's house was rearranged long ago. [Dream logic: the house in question was that of my maternal grandmother, but in the dream the implication is that it was his own mother.] My answer confirms his own recollection, helping him win a bet he had made with the butler. After that, while his attention is elsewhere, the butler offers me a sip of the liquid in his cup, a sly and intimate gesture. Our eyes meet and I feel a surge of desire.   ",,

I saw him try to do it to another woman and she hit him when he tried to touch her. I was thinking, finally someone stood up to this creep, but then someone else said he treated them nicely and bought them dinner and didn't expect/ask for anything else, and made them feel wanted, if only for an evening, but then they have this ""the one that got away"" nostalgic, romantic memory of it.

13286S,"So many dreams, now fuzzy yet all about my estranged husband making life far more difficult, just like real life.  In one dream, he surprise visited me; so I commanded he empty his pockets when I had to leave him unobserved for a moment.  His pockets contained about 20 gift cards, none of them mine; but odd at that time.  I had to pat him down and really did not want to touch him.  Of course, the whole time, he acted as if I was overreacting, even if the judge now has decreed otherwise.  In my last dream, I had to make a weekly trip to Redmond, WA, about 30 miles from home.  IRL, Redmond is where my best friend lives and now my husband, aaugh.  My (dead) mother was there to accompany me for the first time.  IRL, I inherited all our family belongings that, not kidding, date back to the 1200s. I don't know why, but this trip to Redmond had to do with my inherited items (other than the fact IRL my husband photographed them all without my knowledge, then submitted them to the court to attempt to reduce his monetary split with me, although I inherited everything before our marriage).  My mother was astounded I had to take an Uber back & forth.  The price each way started at $30, but that was only for one block.  My cost was exorbitant.  We only could pick up the Uber at train stations, due to virus restrictions; so it was incredible work to journey from the station to home or to your actual destination, now that all public transportation had been shut down.  The train stations were very modern and nice, though.  Since they were open for Uber services, all these vapid jogger girls in bright colors used the long escalators in the opposite direction as workout stair climbers on rainy days.  I guess all parks were closed in my dream.  ",,
21094S,"So many dreams!  All I remember now, though, is packing the house again with my estranged slouse.  IRL, he kept stealing possessions of our friends for his own use and I'd have to threaten court action and confidently utter nonsense laws to return them to the rightful owners.  In retrospect, it was a brilliant method to divert my attention from what he chose to steal from me.  Oh, well.  He can't be happy and treat people badly.    Back to the dream, I discover my slouse has absconded with my parents' ""schoolhouse table"".  It's a plain looking table that IRL actually is very valuable.  I never informed my slouse about it yet he stole the item!  I was so distressed I awakened, then realized this item is not inside my new apartment. I think, ""He really stole that table!""  It takes me a while to review the contents of the big house we just sold and I realize it was not sitting in that location either. Then it dawns on me it must be in storage.  I believe it is safe there.  Whew.  By this time, I am wide awake; so it takes me a bit longer to fall back to sleep.",,
9818S,So many dreams! I can't reember the details now but they were vivid,,
3254S,"So many dreams. I Only remember a few.    -The neighbor's grandson, (who's my age, European & currently lives in China), and I were talking about how, during the Covid pandemic, farm workers in America are considered essential but they earn less than minimum wage, get no vacation days, no sick days. (I'm not sure if we were talking about legal or illegal farm workers.) We has this conversation in the communal kitchen in a dormitory type building. Before he entered I had been looking for a pan to boil water in, but many of the pans had been squeezed into a taco shape, which can't hold water, and which I couldn't use to cook my ravioli.    I was walking down a rather empty street in Sweden; there were no cars, only some pedestrians. There was a very tall man dressed in a short, A-line, light blue dress in front of me, and I recognized him as Petter (a Swede I used to know) and realized it was Halloween.    (I'm not sure if this was many dreams, or many unrelated scenes from one dream - or if this was when pain partially awakens me and thus disrupted the scene but didn't disrupt the subject of the dream. They're all about my best friend, who's 6 months pregnant and had her glucose test yesterday.)  -She flew in the baby nurse who helped her with the first baby, and the woman just slept and didn't help because she was tired from the journey.  -She named the baby Homer, like Homer Simpson, which I found to be an unfortunate choice.  -We were sitting on a cement floor, indoors, and the baby was sitting up facing her, but kept tipping over backwards and hitting his head against the cement. He didn't cry, but I thought that couldn't be good for him, so I moved and put something soft under his head, it may have been my hand, so he could tip over backwards safely.  -She went out with her mom, leaving the baby with me. I had to feed him. She'd left frozen orange and pink pur√©e but the recipe called for 1/2 cup and I didnt know the quantity of the pur√©e which was frozen in diff. sizes & shapes.   -She & the baby were in a cardboard box, which was not very sturdy and which took flight via balloons that were tied to it and propelled by the wind (like in the movie UP.) They flew several hundred feet in the air over a crowded stadium, and she was perfectly calm. Once they safely tumbled onto the people below, who were all on the field as there was no event going on, I told her I wouldn't have felt comfortable at that height. I was fine with being 20 or 30 ft in the air in the balloon propelled box but 200 ft was too high for me;  if something went wrong you'd get really hurt falling from that height.  -Her sister made some very elaborate cards.  For the first card the location of the words made it hard to read. They were not written in a row, they were scattered. I couldn't read it out loud. It was in English, and I knew what the words were, but I just stared. Once we opened it - it was big, like the size of a Manila envelope- there were several regular sized cards inside. Two were for my friend or maybe one for my friend and one for the baby, and much to my surprise she also made a card for me. It had a sparkling unicorn my little pony on it. I think the creature had an aqua colored body with sparkling crystal mane and tail.",,
11257L,So many dreams. That my friend had moved to Denmark with her husband and I was visiting them. That her parents had already seen her new baby and I hadn't. That I got to see the Northern Lights in Iceland. And I saw a childhood friend and her mother. ,,

The next dream Darcelle and I are in the United States and I just bought a yellow Toyota truck with big wheels.  We leave it in a parking lot while our friends pick us up and take us to Silverlake at a coffee shop where we could sit with our laptops and work all day. I t was nice to be driven around.

I remember feeling so sad in this dream when we were leaving. The house seemed so lonely without him. I didn't want to leave my grandma alone    And in real life my grandpa died last summer. I couldnt see him in hospice or go to his funeral because of covid. Im honestly not sure the weight of it all hit me until this dream. I wont see him again.    I actually didn't fully process my great aunt's death until a similar dream yesrs ago too.    4) we packed our cats in a truck and needed to urgently get to Austin, Texas.

Found out that I had power s of some sort but didn't understand them fully.     In a competition. I was separated from the only person I knew there who was supposed to guide me. Got a bit lost in the arenas headed to where my team was (face carved up into a cucumber snake by a team leader who was upset I wandered into danger)     It was the end of the world. Things were raining from the sky, like meteors or giant balls of ice. I was running and trying to take cover under awnings as I ran. I was on my own, and I was terrified of whether a loved one had experienced this, if they were hit, and if any of us were going to survive.    At the arena there was a bunch of contests to pick a winner. The last one, for some reason, we were all in pools that were connected in a circle but instead of water we were making lemon meringue pie filling that we would later cook and eat in pie s, despite us wading through our pie filling (yuck...) When you finished a pie, you could stamp something on the pie (like a message) you tell an older woman what phrase you want and she would do it for you. You couldn't stamp and taste your own pie, someone had to anonymous ly give one to you. So done gave me a pie and I was trying to figure out who could have given it to me with some assistance from friends. It was maybe someone named Anne (I'm not close with anyone named this), or perhaps another old friend. The arena was in the process of being judged. I took my pie to have it stamped with something related to friendship being important or something like that. Then, the arena was under attack. The ceiling was crumbling, and we knew there must have been an insider that betrayed us. Instead of fleeing, I still insisted on standing in line to get my pie stamped, then I rushed to try and figure out who had betrayed us. I think it was perhaps my old friend Tobias, who I haven't seen or spoken with in years. I woke up in the dream in my childhood bedroom. For some reason I had a pet rat, and there was a small dog asleep on my lap. For some reason, I knew the dog was evil. I worried it might attack the rat. I thought about introducing the dog to a nearby vet to establish care, but then I remembered the vet probably died when the ceiling came caving in. I wondered if the school term counted as the final was interrupted and everyone had to flee. I wondered how to contact anyone, like the Dumbledore-like headmaster. I thought about magically communicating, then I thought cell phones were more clear, although I had no idea whether someone like that even has a cell phone. Either way, I realized it was Saturday morning and I should wait until at least Monday to contact anyone due to politeness and social convention.   ",,

I said what about starting with Season 4? I saw the Season 4 DVDs. Then I saw Season 3, 2, and 1. Yeah, said Steve, 1! Then next to the first season there was a Curious George book. I pulled it out and started reading. The words in the book were so worn it was hard to read. But some of the words had been written over in pen. On the second page it said in the narration [my name] (redacted for participant de-identification!). I said wait a minute. This book must be mine!

In another part of the dream, or perhaps a separate dream, I was looking at Instagram and saw Amanda S.'s photo and saw that the photo was taken exactly where I was standing at that moment, in front of my house. I wondered what she was doing here. Then I scrolled through her photos and saw that she and Eve were both here. Later I was walking with a big group of people (it was like a camp or work group, we were all together and walking to host a school event) and I said guys, before we start, can I tell you something? And I told them that two of my hip high school friends had just moved to the area for reasons unknown. Amanda was there walking with the group and only after I had said it I realized that she was one of the two people I was talking about. She talked about how Eve was researching OCD and continued to say something to the group leader but I couldn't hear her.

I also saw a vintage Sesame Street scarf that used to be Jeremy's. In the furniture section of the store, I was talking about work with an older couple who were sitting on a couch. They asked me if I wanted an academic job and I got angry and loud, like ""oh sure, of COURSE I want to devote all my time to teaching and making sure my students have an enriching experience AND publishing several papers a year AND completing my coursework well to make sure I get good grades (I was now describing being a grad student) AND applying for funding, etc., oh, by the way, did I MENTION you have to write a DISSERTATION?

I was on the top floor of a building and I had to get out. I went down in an elevator and it landed in a Japanese restaurant in the basement. I spoke to the waitress in Japanese, telling her how many people there were, but we had to order in English. There were trays being handed out with onigiri and sushi. I tried to grab a tray of umeboshi sushi but instead I just got plain onigiri.     I was practicing an interview with Anum for an unpaid internship.

The other women were Liz from Nick Viall's Bachelor season and Steve's friend Caity. After moving stuff in, Caity went home to her boyfriend while Steve and I stayed in the new apartment (not sure where Liz was at that point). Caity sent me a text message on an iPad. I was exhausted from moving. Her text asked what time she should come over based on when we were eating dinner. The text showed up like a survey, with a Likert scale response format. I was so tired I didn't want to have dinner or hang out with her later. I asked Steve what I should say. He said the earliest option in the survey. Later, at night, Steve asked me to come for a drive with him and Liz. I got in the car sulkily. We went to a sushi restaurant. Caity was there too. As we were standing near the entrance waiting to be seated, Liz and Caity were talking about how Steve must be attracted to women who are very empathetic and caring, since they both were. I hated thinking he had a type like that and thought his attractions were more diverse. Steve was within earshot but acted like he couldn't hear. At our table, I looked at the menu. I took a drink of beer and realized I wasn't hungry at all, but thought I should at least order something small. There was a gyoza meal that came with edamame for $10, and little portions of avocado and rice that were $1 each. An older woman with long grey hair and a rough-looking face came to take our order. I ordered the gyoza and edamame. She said the gyoza were terrible. Oh really? I said. What would you recommend? She said when the gyoza were cooked together for the meals they were horrible, but fine if ordered individually. Oh, I said. Okay, I'll order four gyoza. Which I preferred anyway.¬†    Next dream: two separate girls asked me for directions to a building where they were holding auditions for a theatre production. I knew exactly where they needed to go and pointed out the church that was visible, and the auditorium just in front of it where the auditions were being held. Both thanked me. Then I was walking through a college campus. It was winter, with snow on the ground. I had a long silver ballpoint pen with me that I accidentally marked my lip with as I was walking. I put the pen in my backpack pocket. There was a building I was trying to find, but instead of getting out my phone or a map I just kept walking. In the distance I could see a huge bird suspended in mid-flight in the forest. I walked closer and saw that it was taxidermied.

17651L,"The chronology is a little fuzzy, but I was in a car with Becca D. from high school. She had shaved her head but left a few strands on top. I told her I had a crush on my hairdresser. Then I was on basecamp messaging Alyssa, who asked me what time I was avilable next week. Instead of typing it out, I wrote my availabilities on a piece of paper (e.g., ""Monday all day except 1-2pm""). I took a picture of it and texted it to her but when I looked at my texts I saw that she had texted me a photo of a big dog on her couch. I remembered her and Jeremy saying they wanted to get a dog and feeling annoyed by that for some reason. Then I either walked over or went through the photograph into their apartment and I was there. The dog was sleeping and was using a dog toy as a pillow. He was a big, beige/white great dane but had the softest fur, like the kind of fur you'd see on a fake-fur coat or pillow. He woke up and I put the toy on my shoulder. I was on my phone again preparing my message to Alyssa when she walked out and laughed at me standing there with the toy on my shoulder. I said I was about to text you. Then Alyssa's friend walked into the apartment. He was tall and blonde and looked a bit like Matt Damon. He looked weathered or dirty. He was from the army. Alyssa was cooking chili on the stove. I asked him some questions that he didn't really answer, as if he was uncomfortable about it. He spoke to Alyssa and his accent sounded Scottish. Alyssa said something about him having gone to Bowdoin, and I thought, oh, he's from near the border (US-Canada) and that's why his accent is like that. I had seen something on TV about small communities around there whose accents were still Scottish sounding (this was a dream memory). I tasted a little bit of food, some kind of ingredients. I said I should go. Jeremy walked out into the living room and then back into the bedroom. He seemed very busy. I think his hair was longer and in a ponytail. I went to put my shoes on and Becca was there with me. I said again to Becca I love your hair. She said thank you quietly, like she was ashamed, and I wondered if she had cancer. She asked me again about the hair dresser. She said have you done him yet. I thought for a second she meant have I gone to see him for a hair cut. I said, oh, do you mean have I had sex with him?? No I haven't. In sort of a loud voice. I fell back onto my butt tying my shoes and everyone laughed at what I had said. I said I don't even know if he's real. I have no idea how much of him I've made up. Then my mom and I were walking down a sidewalk and saw either Brad Pitt or Alex Karev from Grey's anatomy with a pink suit jacket and no shirt. Or maybe it was a princess costume with his chest exposed. He was talking to two women. ",,

13446S,"The dream occurred in Havarl, a world in Mass Effect: Andromeda. A cult of female Angara came out from where they had been hiding under a lake. The atmosphere was clearing and the sunlight was intensifying, which made sense on the Angaran homeworld, given their biological dependence on light, but they had adapted to a thicker atmosphere, and now it was too strong even for them. It goes without saying that it was too strong for humans. I wondered if I needed to tinker with the monoliths to thicken the atmosphere slightly and further increase the planet's viability.     Later sleep period:   I was playing a board game. It was called ""Uno,"" but had no resemblance to the WL game by that name. Each player had two piles of cards, one of which was the draw pile, which contained abilities and events, and the other pile pertained directly to the character in some way. An optional (public?) pile contained locations.     I pulled a card from the location pile and it revealed goblin racers in an alley. I realized that it demonstrated the supernatural elements that were hidden in the superficially ordinary city represented on the game board.     Earlier in same sleep period:  I drove to a restaurant to pickup dinner, but before heading home, sat down at an outdoor picnic table to drink two pomegranate-based cocktails in small mason jars. Later I kicked myself for impulsively drinking them, because I had meant to bring them home. It would have saved time and I could have kept the jars.     I was also bringing home pizza and some other things, so I didn't want to waste too much time and let it get cool. Home was only a five-minute drive away, but I realized I didn't know which direction I needed to turn, so I consulted the map on my phone, which directed me to turn right. I wasn't sure if I would recognize my house when I passed it (apparently we had just moved to the area, which was rural and heavily forested), so I kept my phone out to track my progresss.     However, the terrain was really rough: at one point I had to climb up a multi-tier waterfall, requiring long steps (though in theory I was driving, dream logic had me using my feet at this point) and I was afraid I would sleep and the phone would fall into the water, so I paused halfway up the waterfall to put it safely away in my purse.

The real-life project consists of 88 identical drills with identical equipment and features. The project in my dream was the same but I was scared because someone might find they are not identical.

One older woman loved all the attention and ass-kissing she got from the people courting her for money; that was the reason she donated. She experienced a health issue and teh paramedics came to take her to the hospital, but she didn't want to go and one of the ass-kissers helped her get out of it.  -I was a young adults in the company of other young women. It was late in the evening and one young woman was putting a lot of effort into trying to get the group to go out. ",,

17667L,"The first dream had a D&D structure: I was immersed in the events but also talking with a DM (my husband) about what was happening and my response to it. My character is a young man, perhaps mid-30s, a former soldier. He had been tasked to do something menial, a little too brusquely, by an older, heavier guy who might have been the town leader. I was acting out my role in the conversation with the DM as the NPC was giving me instructions in a slightly condescending manner.    The task involved installing some large filtration stones somewhere. They resembled aquarium filtration stones but were large, around 8 inches wide/long, and I had a box full of them in both disk and cylinder shapes. I was admiring their composite construction: a mixture of different minerals, apparently, but tiny shell-like shelf mushrooms had even been grown on the surface and hardened for an additional filtration layer. I admired that attention to detail.     After being given the box and my instructions I saluted stiffly, barely masking my irritation, and prepared to leave. The quest-giver told me to go to his daughter to get a haircut, but I had another woman in mind who would do a better job, and would serve as a passive-aggressive snub to the old man. I intended to keep the other woman's identity a secret for her own safety, but I would allow the rumors about me visiting someone else to circulate. I know the old man's daughter would be cool with my plan and wouldn't get offended, once I explained the situation, because she was actually pretty cool, even if her dad was a dick.     [No idea where any of this came from, none of the details or patterns seem like day residue.]    Second dream:   In this one I was myself. I was outdoors, and flies were landing on white segmented plates that were stacked in two tiers in front of me, like an empty hors-d'oeuvre tray. The fly swatter was not in arm's reach, and rather than risk letting the flies get away, I grabbed a spray bottle of counter cleaner and doused them so they couldn't fly. I didn't want them to get away so I kept spraying until they were immersed in liquid, each in a separate compartment on a different tier of the tray.     When I looked closer to see if the flies were suitably incapacitated, I noticed that strands of some white substance were now cocooning them under the water. I hadn't liked this brand of cleaning spray but now that I saw how effective it was against flies I figured it would be good to keep on hand. But the cocooned masses under the water were already larger and stranger than I had expected. Had one of the flies been attached to something else? It had appendages... could they be... limbs?     The more I looked, the more mammalian the figure appeared, until I wondered if it was a rat or something. I had no sympathy whatsoever for the flies, but I didn't think my conscience could let me drown a mammal, so I picked up a stick - a sort of thin plastic rod like the stakes that sometimes come in plant pots - and started gingerly trying to pull the white cocoon like matter off the animal-shaped form floating in the water, to see what was inside and if it could be rescued.      I saw reddish fur in the tear I had made and cleared more of the caul away. A fluffy tail emerged. Not a rat, then. Was it a squirrel? A miniature fox? It looked closest to the latter, I thought, as I finished freeing it from the strands and it bounded away. Looking back at the tray, I saw that the second compartment now also had a caul-covered animals.     At first I was pretty sure the second one really was a squirrel, except when I had cleared its tail, it was too thin and pointed. I cleared the rest of the body and discovered that it was a dog! I was glad I had rescued it. The dog also bounded away once it was freed. Now it was full-sized and black - it looked like a long-haired black labrador, were there such a thing.     Meanwhile, other dogs of all shapes and sizes had gathered around, watching. There was something faintly menacing about their attitude that put me on my guard. ""Hey! I just rescued you!"" I protested, swiping my stick in front of me in an attempt to fend them off.     A larger grey dog with very short fur and a pointy muzzle full of triangular sharp teeth, vaguely cartoonish in form (might be based on something real but if so I can't figure out what) stepped forward, while the other dogs hung back. I recognized that he was approaching to fight me in ritualized single combat. Their culture was barbarous, I reflected, but at least it was honorable: as a pack they could have easily overcome me, but instead they chose a fair trial of strength, sending only their champion.     I assessed my opponent. He was an intimidating dog, but his only real threat to me would be his jaws. So I fended him off with my stick while I cast my eyes around for something useful. I found a length of cord of the same plastic as my stick, but thinner and more flexible, and grabbed it. Then when a suitable moment came I wound a loop of it around his muzzle, wound a second loop, then pulled it tight. Now all the leverage was mine, so I put him on the ground while I addressed the rest of the dogs, making sure they acknowledged my victory and asserting my right as victor to impose conditions.     ""You will not make any raids on my territory,"" I commanded. That was a very basic condition, which they accepted without any complaint, so I went on. ""Second: you will not harm any cats on this land!"" This provoked signs of reluctance, but they acquiesced. I wondered if I could get away with a third sanction, testing their limits. ""Same with crows."" It seemed to pass muster.     I concluded by repeating and summarizing my conditions to make sure they were very clear: ""You will leave my people in peace, and you will not harm cats or crows on this land."" With this the treaty was concluded, so I released their leader from my restraint, and the dogs bounded off. I felt a sense of satisfaction at having defended the interests of my allies, the cats and the crows.   ",,
22599S,"The first dream I had involved my 4 best friends from high school. We were attending a kind of debutante ball where everyone had a date in a place that I didn't recognize and we were all in good moods. We left the ceremony very late at night and my friend drove us all home but seemed to be impaired or drunk, so my other friend switched places with her and began driving us home through a dark, windy, woodsy road. My second dream revolved around a man who I did not recognize but who I was casually seeing/dating. He came over to my family's home and we watched a movie and ate dinner with my family. I don't remember what the man in the dream's name was but he was very tall and gangly. ",,
1260S,"The first dream I remember was some of my family was living in a floor of a building.  The development was owned by a Chinese Company and was named NGT.  We returned to our unit (after never seeing it before) and there were towels all over the floor.  Water was leaking from different places.  My husband was trying to figure out from where.  The bathroom shower was right on the floor without any wall and the drain was blocked a little so water was running everywhere.  We couldn't figure out why water was all in the hallway.  I called a maintenance number but the man I spoke with said, ""I don't know.""  We kept looking for numbers to call on the brochure.  My second dream was (again) a house dream.  My sister was looking for a place.  I went with her.  She had a child on her hip that I think was hers.  (All her children are grown).  It was a really neat unit on a second floor.  I told her that I would go in on it with her.  We walked around the unit and then went to a porch outside that had astro turf and a table.  We sat down and across from us (at another table) was an older woman and we thought maybe her grandson.  We thought maybe she was the owner.    ",,
2282S,The first dream was a type of breakfast gathering at a summer camp near a lake.  It was off season so no campers were there yet.  A school in our town was having it.  The school I work for is grades K-3.  This school is grades 4-6.  I was invited to attend along with some other people from my school but it was mostly staff and students from their school.  I talked to some old students outside at a picnic table and then some adults.  We all moved into the big building where there were round tables set up.  We formed winding lines to go up to the cafeteria window to get our trays and breakfast.  The second dream I had was at our house.  I was working on our car in our driveway and the hood was up so it was blocking my view.  I heard a bunch of voices and then looked up to see my oldest son smiling at me.  He surprised me. He had driven up from PA with his girlfriend.  I hugged him and then looked down the driveway and saw another one of my sons.  He drove from VA and I yelled out because I was so happy to see him.  I've been worried about him because he's an evening manager at a grocery store in Virginia.  My husband knew they were coming and they had surprised me.,,
8760S,"The first dream was about running a restaurant making Indian style snacks out of smoked tofu, and they were terrible.  This is a combo of a video my friend sent me of her tofu tikka masala, part of an Instagram story of a celebrity chef finding smoked tofu in their fridge, and reading an Indian cookbook before going to bed.  I shifted into a work dream after that, but I've lost the details since waking. ",,
11592S,"The first part of the dream I was visiting a friend (who in real life was recently laid off because of covid-19) with my parents to help her out and drop off a used car.  I got furious because I had just taken over my brother's ancient used Camry (true in real life) and then my parents gave her a lightly used Mercedes convertible (not true in real life, though my grandma had one). Then it shifted into a stressful work dream. ",,
2398S,"The first part of the dream was me asking my friend how their new dog was doing. He started to tear up so I looked at his partner and remembered that she had already told me Nova had died by being trampled by rats. (I think this is because before bed I was talking to my partner about "" if everything was free in Walmart for 10 min"" answer: trampled). After that we got into some van and were going somewhere secretly. The next thing I remember was going to a build a bear like set up but you had to sew everything yourself. You picked out the initial fabric while sitting in your car, then they brought it out to you (kinda like what stores are doing for social distancing) then once you sewed the initial step you went into the store. The woman at the check in desk said I did a terrible job and pointed out all the bad seams. I defended myself by saying I haven't sewed since high school and it was my first one. Then my high school boyfriend showed up. He looked like I remembered and he was still a jerk, but he knew all the things that my current partner knows. He made fun of me for being late as a raced around the store to try and fix my project. At some point it was urgent that he get my mom and bring her to the store but I don't remember why. He was always a selfish pig and refused. I then wrapped the whole project in fabric that looked like what I used to make liners for my rat's cage, so that nobody could see what I did and fled in the van from the beginning of the dream. (I think it's because I'm stressed about sewing covid masks) ",,

Every episode was from the point of view of one of the main characters, and it felt like I was that character as I watched the episode (that is everything was happening to me). It turned out that the character Eleven was actually an alien trying to keep the reality of this section of the universe from falling apart, but there was this troubled section in Hawkins Indiana, 1986 (which is where and when the show is set). Eleven didn't even know she was an alien, she was just sent to Earth by other members of her highly intelligent alien species, and tried to keep things together there. The villains were some people pretending to be owners of an ice cream shop. They sold ice cream that was 50 cents cheaper than the grocery store kind to lure people in. At one point the character that I was got killed by one of the villains. That was a unique way to die in a dream, but I still got to go to the next episode and be a different character though. Unfortunately I woke up before I got the last episode. ",,

He said do you know where it is. I said no. He said in the back room. I said what is it. He made a gesture to imitate it. I gathered it was a statue. I went to the back and found a table filled with objects. I picked up a Buddha. The table was getting wet. The roof was a screen. I figured if these things were under a screen it was okay if they got wet. I thought no, it wasn't Buddha. They're not Buddhist. I saw the Hindu elephant god statue and thought yes that's it. It was in a big bowl with little bits of white flower petal stuck to the bottom. I picked up the bowl and statue and went back to the stage. By this point the audience was streaming in. I thought maybe I should have been faster. I gave the bowl to Dewa. He said where are the flowers? I knew somehow that he meant blue flower petals. I said do you want me to get them? He said yes. The gamelan had started to play already. I ran out. I thought even if I ran I might not make it back in time, because I had to go across town. And what would I do?

An older man walked up to me and asked if I was working. I said I'm not on shift, but I work here. He said I'm here to pick up the stuff (he may have been more specific but I forget what he was picking up -- instruments?). I said oh, I didn't recognize you, and went to get his stuff from the back.

I said how about 5 games (the game we were playing usually took many more rounds).¬†    I was walking home and a young guy was following me and talking to me. Something happened, I forget if it involved him, and I was on the ground crying. A group of people came to help me. Chris M. and Hannah (Kitten Lady) were there. I hugged Chris' leg. Hannah was talking to me. There was a dog or two there, puppies, and one lay down on my chest. People were worried the dog would bother me but it felt nice.¬†    I was partnered with a girl and we were about to play a game. We decided to play rock paper scissors to see who went first. We both said ""janken..."" in the Japanese way.

10485L,"The interface resembled a two-dimensional 16-bit game, with big chunky pixels. The theme was mining. I had to dig down through a brown texture representing earth, interspersed with blue rectangles imprinted with question marks. These represented books, but their titles were unknown until I unearthed them. The goal was to find a particular book. There were also optional pamphlets that could be collected, but I skipped those.     I reached the bottom before finding the book I was looking for, and the game presented me with a quiz on a book by Albert Camus, titled ""The Plague."" Oh good, I thought, I just finished the audiobook of this recently, it should be easy. I woke up with the question still clear in mind:    Question:   While early in the book the symptoms of the Plague are described as being similar to bubonic plague, by the end of the book, many...     a) emerged to see a new way of life unimaginable before;  b) continued more or less as before;  c) spontaneously recovered and went about their lives.    I was stumped, and had no idea which answer was correct.     Note:   What intrigues me about this dream is the way it interferes with my actual memory. I know there was an author named Camus, but I don't think his first name was ""Albert,"" and I know he wrote a book called ""The Stranger,"" but I don't think he wrote a book called ""The Plague."" The problem is, the dream memories are interfering with my WL memories to the point where I can't actually be sure. This ambiguity is always so interesting. I prevented myself from googling until I recorded my account. If his first name wasn't ""Albert,"" what was it? Why can't I remember?     Oh! I googled it. His first name *was* Albert. And he *did* write a book called ""The Plague."" So the problem was not as I thought: it was not that dream memories were interfering with the real ones, but rather that *because* I dreamed these things, I doubted they were actually real. Did I ever read this book? I don't think so, but I'm increasingly convinced that I came across a synopsis of it within the last few months.    ",,

There was something in the toilet so I flushed it down, but as I flushed I realized there were two small goldfish in the tank. Maybe this was why it hadn't been flushed. But it was too late. Then as it flushed the entire tank got sucked into the ground, and a new one came back up with a different creature. I turned around and saw a wall of different creatures. You could pick which one you wanted. It was a school program. I flushed and flushed and each time a new fish or creature came up. Two times a small octopus came up but it was in the toilet bowl, not the tank, and I shuddered to think what would happen if someone used the toilet while the octopus, who was moving around, was in there.

A man escorted me to where the ladies room was which was down the aisle of the theater and on the floor was my Visa card and I couldn't imagine why it was there since I hadn't used it recently and hadn't been to this theater. The door to the ladies room was odd and I asked the man escorting me but he assured me that was it and it was as a woman then came out.   I was at a house or apartment of someone I knew. It felt like we were friends but I also felt subordinate to her and it seemed I was there because J needed shelter or something. I was hungry but felt uncomfortable taking food. She had other women friends over. They were laughing and sitting at a table. I felt left out or uncomfortable being there although they were not unfriendly to me. I told her I was leaving and I saw the women were coloring and I commented. They said it was very relaxing to do so.

I think I was a princess (I watched The Windsors last night), I went scuba diving (I took a half hour resort pool class when I was a kid, but otherwise I've never scuba diver before) through a fairly deep section of water, though there was still decent visibility. I had been there before, I found a vertical pipe underwater where I turned a valve and a photo album (somehow not damaged by the water) came out. Back on land, I was going through the photo album and I saw younger pictures of Lauren partying at her house with our friends, but not me (I felt left out, but IRL I've only known her for a few years).

We were rehearsing in my parents' music room, and unfortunately the solos seemed to be going to slightly older colleagues of mine from the Bay Area. I noticed that an old Cambridge classmate was there - someone who is now making a career as a conductor in Europe. I thought I'd try to reconnect professionally, so when we were told to stand in mixed formation I went to stand by him. We had a nice chat about Vaughan Williams during the break. But he started mansplaining how to sing while also sort of groping me, once the rehearsal resumed. I was kind of letting it happen, reluctantly, because I thought it still might help my career. I mentioned that I was trying to get back to the UK. He asked where I wanted to live in London, and I mentioned my budget and desire to be near a Tube station.  He suggested an area (apparently where he lived) and then began referring to me as his new girlfriend. I couldn't seem to get him to leave me alone, even by repeatedly mentioning my husband, until what I believe was a very large ferret or mink appeared and began gnawing quite hard on my elbow. Luckily the creature mostly got a mouthful of wooly sweater, and I shook it off. It immediately went after this former friend, and I managed to escape to my parents' bedroom on the other side of the house. The ferret thing was clearly causing chaos throughout the house by biting various colleagues who'd caused unpleasantness in the past. I was glad to be locked in a room away from all of it.",,

I wedged myself between the doors of the next elevator to watch and listen. My friends found me though. I went downstairs and then the person I was watching came out and wasn't doing anything suspicious afterall, he was just moving out with his family.     Downstairs was like a gathering of friends /coworkers. I missed most of it and helped clean up at the end.     There was a part  where I was out taking a walk with my little cousin and I think I was still trying to solve some mystery. I had a bouquet of flowers and dropped them in a hole alongsode the sidewalk. I told him to be careful not to fall in. Then I retire ed the flowers and as we turned the corner I think there was a lion on the loose or something involving a large animal. Maybe it was part of the mystery.     In an earlier part of my dream, I was at work in a location I don't recognize and I don't know what my job really was...but I and a coworker were trying to negotiate for a raise. And we were assigned to install two payphones. And so a lot of the dream was figuring out how to install the payphones and figuring out how to get the boss to give us a raise afterall.     We did install them and he came to inspect, and then I think he walked off with one, and the other one wasn't working. So I'm like well there has to be an owners manual around her somewhere and I went around the side of the payphone which turned out to be like the size of a piano and there was a compartment like a glove compartment in a car and inside I'm like aha, look there's paperwork in there. But the first thing I pulled out was a clear plastic bag of items - the same items I sell at my store in real life. So some reality seeping in there.    Then we started to walk a little and down the way I this weird office/outdoor area was a family and the kids were playing with sticks. Thr mom was sitting around a firepit, but there was no fire at the moment. So I started talking to the mom about the stuff they build witth he sticks and how it probably always falls apart because they're kids and stuff gets knocked down.     It was a whole mishmosh of dreams. ",,

17241S,"There was some sort of demonic infestation in the chicken house of the farm where I grew up, and I was attempting to ward it off with an incantation:    ""In the name of the London eagle!"" I was winging it, and wasn't quite sure where that came from. Was there an eagle on London's coat of arms? I couldn't remember clearly, but the situation demanded that I continue.    In the name of-"" I paused, trying to think of the right word. I was getting stuck on 'Australopithecus', but that wasn't right. Wasn't that some sort of early hominid? I thought I needed to invoke some kind of serpent to balance out the eagle. 'Pythaon?' Was that proper Greek? I didn't know, but figured I could run with it for now and look it up later.     The problems had manifested in holes in the ground. There had been a hole in the ground outside in the yard that had filled with water, but I had put in flat stones that I could use to cross. They were an inch or so below the surface, but stable enough.     Inside the chicken house, there were wide holes in two places in the floor. They were full of squirming creatures. Against the far wall, the hole was full of large rats that seemed potentially dangerous. But the hole in the middle of the floor was full of squirming puppies that resembled beagles.     I had run back to the main house for something and come back, crossing the water-filled pool in the yard. But as I paused in front of the door to the chicken house, I wasn't sure if I could open it. I could hear from the sounds inside that the animals had gotten loose, and I wasn't sure if I should open the door in case they got out. I felt sorry for the puppies, which might be hungry, but maybe if I left they would quiet down on their own by evening. Still, it wouldn't be right to leave them without food. And even if I left the door latched, there was no telling that the animals wouldn't be able to escape on their own. They were already pushing at the door. The wood was heavily weathered and weak, and rotting away in the lower corner. I would have to take my chances attempting to go in and get things back under control.     Earlier:   I was in an indoor space, evaluating fabric. I had a purple silk kimono and wanted to line it with silk in another color, so I was going through the available fabric. It came down to two choices, both also silk (you can't really line silk with something that isn't silk). The first fabric I considered was a deep golden yellow. It make a striking contrast with the purple, but I was afraid it would be too bold a statement. The second fabric appeared to be grey in the indoor light, but when I took it outdoors I saw that it was actually a pale blue. It looked alright with the purple outer fabric until the sun caught some turquoise highlights. I thought the turquoise clashed with the purple, so I decided to go with the first choice. I made the arrangements for the kimono to be so tailored, then gathered my things. I had complicated travel plans this evening. A friend had offered me a ride to one of two adjacent towns in central upstate New York, and I needed to decide which one offered the best options to get to my final destination, somewhere a few hours further north.

4242L,"There was something about flooding, and I was somewhere where a state representative was somewhere speaking in a voiceover about how you may need to park your car on higher ground to avoid the flooding (IRL I have off street parking). I was thinking about how much I appreciated by representative (IRL I have no idea who my state representative is, although I signed an online petition that went to my two senators and congresswoman yesterday; I also had video chatted with my aunt and uncle about how our different stay home orders and how ai trust MN Governor Walz much more than the president). The scene changed, and I was both back in high school (but not my real high school) and my current age. There was a wedding on the (way too huge to be real high school) grounds, and afterwards a photographer for was taking individual photos of everyone, but I realized that I needed my purse because I wanted to powder some of the oil/mild sweat (it was the middle of summer in the dream) off my face and refresh my lipstick, as well as have my phone. I didn't have my purse on me, and I was already at about the end of the photo line, so I went for it. I checked my watch (IRL I haven't worn a watch in about a decade, though I did. In high school) and saw that it was either 14:55 or 15:55, I ran along the grounds (I knew that I'd left my purse on the ground somewhere along the main walkway from the school to the photoshoot lineup), and finally made it to the school (IRL I've thought more about running lately, but last ran last summer, I've never been a consistent runner). I couldn't find my purse, I checked in my locker (even though I knew I hadn't left it there), and then went upstairs to speak with a young teacher who was about my age and asked her for help finding my purse (but really also wanted her to offer to fix my makeup for me and help me find my phone). She suggested that I look out the window (per my watch it was 16:10) to see if I could see it, but what I noticed more was that the photographer was nearing the end of the line, I had to race back or I wouldn't have my photo taken at all. By the time I made it there, the photographer had just finished taking pictures, and I knew that meant that I couldn't ask him to take mine since I was only a little late (though IRL I suspect I'd have asked for him to include me since I arrived just past the deadline of whenever he finished with the others). I felt sad, and seemed to see the line like I was on a train and I was seeing the photos and short video clips of my classmates who had had their photos taken. The video clips included then singing to SIX: The Musical (IRL I spent an hour plus filming short video clips to the finale chorus and sent it in to the musical's Instagram account for potential inclusion in a community video they're working on since Broadway shut down just before they could make their debut there, and the West End/other productions are shut down too, due to the pandemic). I was on a train in London that was also a bus and there was something about my luggage. I was towards the front exit area (past the yellow line by the driver), and a professor (not one of mine IRL) intentionally wedged his briefcase in the turnstile so it couldn't turn (I think it contained hard-boiled eggs, which I don't like IRL).  He and I got off the bus in the rain and went into a pub and asked for some variety of help. The scene turned into a brunch buffet (usually for Easter my family goes to a brunch buffet for Easter, though we obviously didn't this year due to the pandemic), and I was looking for horseradish.",,

Then I dreamt about my grandmother (the one with dementia), and I think we must have been at my grandad's delayed memorial service, because she was going to get up and speak. The family was sitting in the front row of seats at a convention centre or something. I remember thinking that the seats were too close together, and also that I needed to floss my teeth.    There was something hazy after that, about the conflict around transitioning to adult size furniture instead of child size as children grow up.    Those last two were very obviously to do with the issues around my grandmother going to a nursing home in the next few weeks. I think I've written about how difficult our relationship has been.

It seemed to come to a head at the big Safeway grocery store - some people in the socially distanced checkout queue got into a fight and threw big blocks of charcoal at each other. There was dust everywhere from that. And then we moved away from them, but my mother thought my new friend was offering condolences for my grandfather's death and gave her a hug, but it was some awkward misunderstanding.

Of course it's all nonsense in hindsight.   Basically there were these characters and one of them finally comes clean about his connection to something going on. He admits some stuff that happened in his childhood and the other character says I knew it! I knew you made those drawings near _____'s bed. It was like a mystery solved. And with the mystery solved, they decided to go to the carnival. Then I arrived by car and I found a good parking spot, but I was told I couldn't park there (because I didn't have tickets, or a permit, or I wasn't supposed to be there) so I decided to move my car into the further parking lot.

Haunting of hill house is highly recommended)  In another dream, I was in a club with my partner (male) and another girl started kissing him. I was drunk, and slurred ""keep your hands off him"" and was rude to her. Then; my partner in the club was a female who I had just started dating (e.g. this person was no longer my boyfriend) and she pointed out that this wasn't necessarily a date; and I agreed that monogamy is only applicable after having a conversation about being in a relationship and not just dating.   In the last part of my dreams; I was in a school (I think it was a high school? It was not somewhere I recognized) There was a kid on his bike, and I complemented him to boost his self-esteem. Later; I was socializing with peers and decided to work on a project rather than going out with people.

So they and the woman decided hiding was not enough, they had to dispose him. They trapped him by luring him to a false party on ibiza then stole his gun, destroyed his vehicle and left him stranded on that island.

And then I woke up and needed to pee, took these notes And went to the bathroom, and then I went back to sleep. Later when I fully woke up this morning I had a lot of deja vu moments.

(The whole dream was quite cleanly narrative and I could specify all the details of these conflicts but I don't think it would be very relevant or interesting.) Eventually the Jewish sister felt guilty because she had been rather cruel to her twin, but she reminded her twin of some past wrongs.

I live on a hill in SF, but the lava still came up that high.  2) (Later in the night) I went to some sort of outdoor seated concert (symphony?) but no one was there. My old professor was working there, but as a younger version of herself, and she made some weirdly racist comments that were totally out of character. I was with a friend from Seattle and it was embarrassing that this woman I had talked about in good light was saying these things. I then had to use the bathroom, so the dream turned into my recurring nightmare where are the toilet stalls were blocked, overflowing, etc.  3) Right before final waking, I dreamt that I was in a bar and had to look after a two dogs, one of which was continuously running around and annoying people.

14471S,"Today's Academic Assembly was about start on Zoom but something was wrong with my laptop. I had meant to log in ten minutes early, since I'm responsible for taking quorum, but when I tried to open the program, it just hung, the wheel spinning. The minutes crept by until the meeting start time. If I could log in now, at least I wouldn't be late. I finally got a browser window open-or was it a finder window? For some reason I couldn't tell the difference-and tried to type in the address, but it still wasn't working.     What if I logged in on my phone? I'd used Zoom before on my phone, it had worked then. But the meeting was password protected, I would have to look it up in my email, and my laptop wasn't working, so I would have to find the email on my phone, which would take longer, and *then* log in. I would certainly be a few minutes late. I could send a hasty email explaining that I was having technical problems... but my computer was completely frozen now, and it would take even longer to try to send the email on my phone, and who would see it in time? They were already starting the meeting.     I was getting really frustrated, and it didn't help matters when I picked up my phone and saw that it was also acting oddly. The background image was something I didn't recognize, some kind of rock formations, and it was rapidly scrolling by vertically, the same image, over and over. I'd never seen my phone do this before. I got past that screen but was still having trouble accessing the right apps. I was definitely late now, and I was so embarrassed and irritated that I left the room and started stalking down the hallway, still staring at my phone.     This was awful. Everything had been going wrong. It felt like a bad dream. If only it were a bad dream. If I concentrated hard enough, could I *make* it into a dream, wake up, start the day over afresh? No, I reminded myself sternly. You can't make something into a dream by wishing it were so.     But *is* it a dream? It certainly doesn't feel like a dream. It feels very real. Still... it doesn't hurt to check. I jumped into the air and... oh. Yeah. I'm gliding several inches off the floor now. It's a dream. That's great! I'm probably not late for the meeting at all! I'm still asleep in my bed, and the alarm I set will wake me up in time!    So what now, knowing I'm dreaming? I didn't have a concrete plan, so I just sort of floated aimlessly. I thought it might be fun to try floating upside down, for for some reason that didn't work at all. As soon as I flipped over I felt myself braced against the ground in a shoulderstand and couldn't float again until I flipped back right way up.     Soon I woke and was pleased to discover that it was still an hour before the alarm was set to go off, and the real Assembly wasn't supposed to start for an hour after that, so I was reassured that everything would probably be fine.

In other words, I was on my way quietly saving $100,000 to divorce him properly.  We still had our two cats, when he decided Wallace, one cat, had a broken heel.  I could not understand how he determined this issue, since Wallace was not limping.  Later, I found bloody vomit on the last basement stair; but I did not know to which cat it belonged.  I wondered if he was poisoning them.  Then I looked outside and there was snow on the ground.  It was May and I was shocked.  It often does not snow here even once per year, let alone in May.  2.  Again, estranged husband is present.  We are attempting to enter Canada by car.  He refuses to observe the social distancing rule, since we are in a car, and he pulls up directly behind the car in front of us.  Border patrol is not happy with his demeanor and refuses us entry.    I am thinking, ""We drove this far and you sabotaged it,"" when my slouse finds another line to enter.  This one demands we exit our vehicles for an interview.  The first question is ""Married, single, or divorced?""  My slouse sits back in his omniscient posture and explains we are none of the above, that we are married yet divorcing.  He decides to explain further about how ""people just grow apart"", to which I add, ""That is code for 'he cheated'."" He does not hear anything I said and pontificates no one is to blame, he harbors no animosity, yadda yadda.  I interject, ""I want to kill him,"" in a figurative sense.  The border guard seems to empathize.  Then my husbland asks me a question about one of his achievements, something like, ""How long did it take me to make $1 million, I mean, one million US dollars?"" He was seated on a black swivel office chair, while I was slated to a wooden bench made of old splintery crates.  Yet my perch meant I could reposition myself into a more loungelike stretch with my back to him.  As I rearranged myself, I muttered, ""Thankfully, these tidbits no longer are my job to track nor applaud.""  Then I decided to awaken and here I am.",,

10617S,"Two Dreams:    1.  My once-best friend's husband Jeff, the woman who slept with my husband a while back, & who continues to possess grand schemes to acquire our money (so in this divorce, I fight both my husband and her, aaugh)...So back to Jeff, he had to organize his art collection with some curators inside an opulent mall.  I was there and none of us told them there would be a small original Van Gogh; so one assistant placed it unsecured atop a black grand piano, just inside a main door to the mall.  There was a very kind and appreciative art museum woman there, so I whispered to her the presence of this valuable painting.  We walked to the piano and it was gone!  I panicked and could not find Jeff.  As usual, he'd overly layered his clothing and went somewhere to shed his camelhair jacket.  Finally, I find him convivializing with people at a clear crystal escalator landing above me.  I motioned emergently for him to come to me.  He complied immediately; yet once he arrived to the main floor, more people recognized him and he began to chat with them.  I told him about the missing painting and he was not terribly affected by this news and continued to hobnob.  So I returned to the piano and started my search.  By this time, the art group already had looked and were sitting in a row in those airport-style black Barcelona chairs, holding their purses open.  I was certain none of them had stolen it; so I continued the search.  Miraculously, I found it on a small circular antique table partially hidden by fern fronds.  I was so relieved!!  I carried it with me from that moment forward.  Once out on the street, two very handsome and beautifully dressed tall British men asked to look at it for a moment.  For some reason, I handed it to them.  Jeff now was present and wished it to happen.  One man quickly used a Swiss army knife to open the back and held up the flimsy paper.  The Van Gogh was a piece of magazine print and worthless, other than the gold leaf frame.   Dream #2:  I had forgotten to check on my mom after one week of quarantine.  IRL my mother is dead from cancer.  In the dream, she was still alive yet compromised by the cancer treatments.  I was kicking myself for forgetting she existed.  Then she ended up staying with me in a basement apartment and I realized I had been to the store the day before she arrived.  I could be exposing her to the virus and I had not properly sanitized the house.  I felt horrible and finally truly understood the weight of this pandemic on others (since I live alone presently).  We saw a neighbor and my mother had a horrible time talking due to her tongue cancer; but I was reminded how much fun and charming she was with strangers.  She always was far more alive than most folks and full of daring exploits.    She never got sicker in the dream, though.  Still, that responsibility was suffocating.",,
14367S,"Two dreams:  1.  With my mother in 1962 in Paris.  She ""finds"" (My mother was quite adventurous, so I never knew most of her details.  Even on her deathbed, she never would tell me Michael Jordan's secrets he confided in her during many a beach walk.) over US$10,000 in a roll of cash.    For some reason, we desperately need this money, as if our lives depend on it.  I recall being forced to jettison any consideration of ethics in this matter.  The police know she has it and we are on the street.  The gendarmerie cars are closing in on one side of us and my mother elects to run to an opulent hotel across a large park.  I think we will be trapped; but then I realize it is 1962 and people have more access to stairwells and exit doors than we do today.  So I run with her.  We have to pretend we are one of the guests and kind people keep interrupting our beeline for an emergency stairwell.  Throughout or escape attempts, I have to keep reminding myself it is 1962 and times are different.  Oh, the wonderful hairstyles along the way.  The hotel was beautiful, too, with much gold leaf and scalloped details near the ceiling.  Not to mention the enormously regal chandeliers.    2.  There is a young man in our neighborhood, like many of my neighbors, who does not seem ever to work; yet can gad about town perpetually.  He seems to know everyone.  From what I can gather, he arranges events, like festivals; and he links politicians to community matters.  Not long ago, he walked me to my car when an unwanted male was gyrating against me at a concert.  In other words, he is a connected gentleman.  In the dream, I elected to engage in a menage a trois with him and his mistress, as he is married.  My estranged husband was still around and I did nothing to hide my escapade.  I also did not announce it.  I figured I had seen proof of his deceptions; now I can live my own life.  IRL, I never would infringe on any marriage, even if the wife condoned it.

It may have been protesting abortions but I'm not sure. I discovered that there were plastic letters (very similar to my daughters bathtub toys) that were actually bombs and told President Obama. I went with someone else to pick up the bombs until we realized we were being watched. Then there was a wedding in the middle of campus that threw everything into chaos.  Then, suddenly, the school was being overtaken by nazis. Tons and tons of nazis. So a group of us ran and got into a car. We threw our cell phones out the window and kept switching cars to get to safety. I think president obama was still with me but I don't know. We kept switching vehicles to evade capture. Then I woke up. Weird dream #2: I was involved in a drag show which was actually a modeling thing. I looked at one of the models resumes and it was truly the worst resume I've ever read. So I started correcting it and then told her to just send headshots instead. Then, suddenly, there was a group of teenage girls figuring out how to blow something up. So they used a compact mirror, whiskey and a lighter. And they put it into a little droid thing and then it blew up and the house next door collapsed.

This does not appear to be ideal results. The thistles are producing long, coarse fibers that resemble thick woolen yarn, so I start collecting big handfuls of these fibers and strewing them around the floor in the first room. I think they might help by serving as mulch or nesting material for small animals. I make sure to leave handfuls at the base of the bookshelves where mice might be sheltering.

I notice that the pants I'm wearing are producing the same kind of long woolen fibers, so I grab additional handfuls from them and strew them in the room.

However, someone too this little bolt from.his belt and refuses to give it back, keeping him from being able to do it.

Im making crackers again, slowly and gently shaping them on a stone slab with my former friend ( the dragon guy) working beside me. The boss calls him away, saying she has reassigned him. I am extemely fearful now. He emerges on a stone outcropping overlooking our station. He is fully transformed and a dark storm sprays lightning behind him   Then our boss emerges, whacks him with something and toss his paralyzed form down to the cracker making master.

My closest female cousin said that they called this the ""Christmas Room"" and the decor stayed up all year. I found this very unlike my Aunt and Uncle. I made some small talk with my nieces. Complimented the older ones curly hair style. The younger one was very petite and slim. Guessed that she must wear a size 0, 2 or 4 and she responded she wore a size 2. These girls are young adults, early 20's in the dream. My s-i-l made some non descriptive comment about the younger daughter, in her usual dismissive manner. I thought ""nothing has changed with her."" People were leaving and platters of uneaten pastries were being divided up for the guests to take home. My brother, who I did not interact with and had only ever come to these gatherings because  he was keeping up appearances, announced they were leaving in his usual flat monotone. I was an observer. Watching people be their usual selves. The only odd thing was the setting, location, rooms. Imagine I added the Xmas decor as that was when we would all gather in the past.   I had a conversation yesterday about forgiveness implying anger. My belief is I am no longer angry with my brother. That he no longer has a place in my life. That he was always ""apart"" from the family, he had openly spoke of his hostility to the people in my dream, and I was reminding myself that nothing had changed. He no longer belonged with the rest of us.",,

2729S,"Walking near the house where I grew up with my parents, which has an aqueduct behind it.  A man had dug a hole into the aqueduct and set up shop selling survival supplies like buckets of 20-year shelf stable meals.  I got my dad to come in with me so we could get food for them.  The hole was small but about two stories deep with small rooms selling various supplies.  It was empty when we arrived but had a long line of people eventually waiting to come in since they couldn't all fit in at once.  We got our stuff and left.  I thought it would be a good idea to build a similar shelter, so found a spot further down the aqueduct.  I started digging, but it would have taken a very long time to build out a similar space, so we found one that someone else had vacated.  It was almost identical to the shop.  It was a small space, but in one of the rooms downstairs there was enough space to stretch.  I did some stretching exercises to try to imagine feeling comfortable and adjusted in this space.  I though that if I could find a way to make it comfortable, to stay in good spirits despite the small space, I could convince my parents to stay there and be safe with me.  After a bit my mom was more restless than my dad.  And I was concerned about the structure of the space, one of the walls in the bathroom was starting to cave.  First the toilet paper roll holder fell down because the wall was crumbling too much.  Then I couldn't plug anything into the outlet because it had fallen behind the slouching wall.  Stress building but I tried to stay calm.  At some point we went outside.  We looked down the hill from the top of the aqueduct at what used to be our backyard and there were many people in a kind of controlled chaos.  The general sense was that they were looking for supplies, trying to fight for limited resources.  This was the scenario I wanted us to avoid by staying calm and safe and well protected inside.  Some people were throwing stones at each other.  I was mortified and said this to my mom but she seemed drawn to it and walked down the hill to join the people.  She just walked around with them, seeming to take on their more desperate, autonomous manner.  She didn't look back.  My dad was still calm, and I was too, but was sad she left.",,

I really wanted to go inside, to explore it and see all the secrets of the house but was certain I'd never be allowed in. Walked on and found that the front of the house was open, 2 musicians were practicing in the entrance, behind a gate, looked down on me and it confirmed I was not welcome. But then  I saw a sign that said the house was open for a symphony performance, and even though the musicians were looking down on me, I went in and was super happy. I've always loved houses, I love designing them, drawing them, looking at them from the outside and wondering about odd corners... I walked through the house, it was old and grand and derelict, and exactly as fascinating and eccentric as I'd thought it would be, with super high ceilings, old libraries, dusty banisters and odd WWII era sky-lights, and a room lined with beautiful black leaf-shaped ceiling fans you might see in Morocco.

My iPad was not working right and I could not  get the map page to close in order to check the weather. The maps just kept getting more and more deep in pages with no way to close or go back. Then I thought I should look on my phone...it did the same thing.  I told the friends I couldn't help them and they just casually walked away while I was looking at my phone which I also thought strange.  Meanwhile I continued to fiddle with my electronics and decided it was a computer virus and wondered how we were going get along without the internet on our trip. Got to the car and it started to rain. Oddly saw the friends again in a lot near where we were parked and they were on a bench covering themselves with those clear ponchos. I called out to them to come to the car. I emptied the backseat which put an enormous amount of stuff in the front with us and I was concerned we would be way too hot. We drove to another nearby spot -  I asked my spouse why move and he said for a better view.

There was a medium sized dog sleeping, stretched out near the doorway. Adjacent to that was a generic bathroom door. I opened the door and there was another dog sleeping there. Same position as the first dog and similar in size. I wondered if they belonged to the owner or customers. We could never take our dog out like this because she didn't get along with other dogs, though we had tried when she was a puppy to train her to do so.   Thought: in thinking about the end of the dream, my first thought/message to myself  was ""Let sleeping dogs lie.""

7686S,"Was living in a neighborhood with houses built in the 1800's. Every room had a fireplace. Elegant looking but always in need of maintaining and not very practical in terms of heat loss with all of the chimneys. But, have always liked these houses.Had a female friend visiting. Wanted to show her an unusual shopping area. We were going to race there on bikes. Going to time ourselves with stop watches. (Haven't biked in over 20 years) We're ready to leave and I remember we don't have the stop watches. I ask my son (teenager, I think)  to please get them for us. He does and we leave. I was sure I knew how to get there but we are getting lost and end up back close to home. We pull over while I try to sort things out. Thinking that was the advantage of cars with GPS. A kindly looking man in his 60's comes over and asks if we need help. I assure him we are fine. I don't want to admit that I am confused because I just need some time to get my bearings, I think. There are cars on these roads and a freeway nearby. But not heavy traffic. At some point, either before we left or while we are stopped, I talk about the problems with lighting the fireplaces in these old houses. That they are shallow and the rooms get Smokey. It's bad for people with lung issues yet a friend with asthma does it all the time. I think she is just making her asthma worse. ( This friend that I'm referring to, in real life, never a smoker but a very irrational person, died from lung cancer 2 years ago) I also had assured the person I was biking with that she didn't have to buy anything. That some shops were outrageously expensive but they were interesting places. By getting lost, I realize the stop watches were pointless.   PS: Self interpretation is that I'm not sure where the future is taking us, I think I know how to get there, but it's not straightforward like I planned. Timing things and planning things out isn't going to work. Time frames are now useless. But, I'm not alone, family knows I'm ""out there"" and strangers are ready to help. Cars/busses have been a motif in my dreams for my whole life and always related to issues around where I am going in life. This is the first time I can recall a bike being the mode of transportation and it doesn't have GPS to guide me. Plus, it is slower. I have to figure this out on my own, but I don't have a paper map either. And others will help me figure this out. Although I have a vague plan in mind. Because I thought I knew what I was doing, where we were going. I'm guessing that this is the result of covid19, our new reality. Plans have to be changed. We don't know where we're going. I thought that I knew. Also, with covid19 affecting the lungs, inserting the friend who died in real life from lung cancer, who had botched her treatment by not doing what she should have or listening to her medical team, which cost her her life is related to the people I know who are being less than careful now because they ""need"" to go shopping. Not something that's important to me and that I consider foolish.  And if the deceased friend hadn't signed a DNR saying no resuscitation, she could have been intubated when she had an anaphylactic episode ( She was in Spaulding rehab and ready to be discharged in 2 days) and would still be alive. Message to self has always been that people need to really think things through, realize what they are signing. Cooperate with the medical advice. So, I think part of the dream message was in support of our strict self- quarantine and assuring myself we are doing the right thing. ",,

We arrive and the house is chaotic, things on counters, not tidy as I had expected it to be and they are both busy doing other things yet acting like all is going as planned.

I think, in the dream, I am trying to deal with ""the enemy"" but I do feel out of place, one down, as M and S are very verbal, controlling people and I know that I am no match for them. Good people, who are better speakers than I, have not won the battle in community confrontations with them. I am uneasy, wary, worried, concerned but also, observing the what is going on in their house, which feels chaotic and not the tidy, perfect place I expected it to be. Biggest feeling is of being inadequate, less than and I do not trust or like these people.   I feel more helpless vs current politics than I do vs the virus. For the virus, I just need to stay in quarantine, which I am happy to do. However, within 3 weeks I will have to physically go to my pharmacy to pick up a drug I need to sign for in persona.

The plaster needs to dry, but I also think it's totally unsuitable because clothes will get damaged by the coarse plaster surface.

I was in a kitchen with a bunch of people I didn't know when it occurred to me that we were crowding too close together. I tried encouraging everyone to maintain a safe distance. Although there were several strangers, I realized the risk was minimized if they were a cohabitating unit. On the other hand, if they showed no regard for distancing in this situation, that suggested they were generally reckless, so I was not reassured.     Later, outdoors under a big tent, we were talking to my father-in-law when I realized we had just flown here yesterday, so there was no way we should be mingling. What if we had picked up the virus on the plane and were still asymptomatic?

24299S,"We had two cats (not our actual cats). One of them was nervous, and I was trying to find a space where he could feel secure. In the kitchen (not my real kitchen) I found a small, square tunnel, like a ventilator shaft, that led to a different room in the house. I had forgotten that was there.     *    I was in a hotel. A waiter brought me a big platter of sushi. He apparently got the impression that I was rich, so he told me he was comping the platter. He clearly hoped that I would respond with a huge tip, and ""hinted"" that it should be along the lines of $500/hour. I said nothing, though obviously I thought that was absurd, and quietly calculated that I would tip $50, which was about what I would have paid for the platter, so it seemed fair.     For some reason, the platter was accompanied by a vinyl record. I happened to have an old-fashioned record player in the room, so I thought I might listen to it. I hadn't used one of these in many years, but I thought I remembered how to do it. I reflected how cool it was that vinyl records remain relevant. Good technology doesn't so easily become obsolete. And I was pleased that I had a real record player from the 1970s-I thought it was the one I'd had as a teenager-which was even preferable to the retro USB ones you can get nowadays.     For some reason the record was making sound even before I put the needle down, which I didn't quite understand, but didn't question too much. I carefully laid the needle on the outer groove, and then I was satisfied that things were working properly.     It wasn't a musical album, but a monologue by what sounded like a middle-aged British man. I don't remember what he was talking about, because my attention was distracted by my iPhone, which appeared to be exporting the audio. This also didn't make much sense to me: it wasn't even hooked up to the record player.   ",,

Just as the 2 workers were leaving I noticed a big footprint in the cement.  One worker was wrapping up equipment so the other jumped out of their truck and repaired whatever inconsiderate traffic had done. The man across the street had his walk way done too.

Before they are here 10 minutes we get the cops called on us for breaking social distancing. They dispurse everyone but ask for me to step aside and to keep my hands where they can see them. They they tell me that they have Info that I've been up to something illegal (I forget what) and are about to arrest me when someone convinces them I've been framed and they let me go. I realize its Aubry Plaza that is trying to frame me out of spite for dumping her or something. I'm trying to get proof by going to a mall but she keeps being one step ahead and trying to stop me, at one point trying to cause an accident with a Semi and then fleeing (this is the point I realize its her as I see the back of her and I see the green Keychain I gave her as she runs). I realize she tapped my phone and she's hearing me figure all of this out with a cute foreign blond girl while I'm figuring out how to focus an expensive camera.     Segue to me going to some family party for maybe Christmas and when I get there my mom is super passed I forgot to bring the ham even though we live at the same house and starts screaming how I ruined chirstmas. I put up with that for like 2 hours screaming back and forth, at one point ordering pizza hut to get delivered. It gets here super late and is contactless so no one tells me its here and when I go out to check and there is a fawn just out there eating it. I try to shoo it off but it fights back until I finally get it to run but not before it tramples another box.

One of our friends Kaysie is having a virtual wedding that we are about to attend and mark is supposed to do photos and we put on our covid mask and start the wedding but it transports us there and we can interact with thing as long as we stay within a certain area otherwise we disconnect. We get there right before the ceremony and its being hosted in this ritzzy waffle house in a mall. Kaysie tells us we can eat whatever we want and we only see these 3 chocolate lollipops in the room on what I think is a wedding cake because it is 3 tiers but its not frosted or fancy so I think its a bad idea but foreign girl takes the little red heart, Mark takes the bride and groom and when no one says anything, I take this tall blue one. Part way through eating it the bride and groom are super angry and take them away from us telling us those were the few things you couldn't eat and point to this tiny sign the size of a car registration, half under a picture frame, asking us to not touch those 3 things. Mark then has to go swap phones because the photos aren't working for him and has to walk out the real door past them. We then swap to a side room like a living room with large leather chairs and they are still passed at us and some new guests come in and sit in the stairwell going to the second floor. The bride and groom tell us to write something but don't give us any paper but we see some yellow sticky notes on the wall and ask if we can use those and are sternly told no by them again.",,

Elizabeth Warren was in an ad about getting credit for helping people with their resume. There was an old guy there that only had $7,600 in retirement savings. There was a 45 cent stock called PRSNDT and a slightly cheaper one called PENCE that existed but weren't being publicly  traded until 2024, which in the dream was next year. It wasn't a COVID world, but it wasn't quite the same as before either. Before that, I was at the beach. Before that I was trying to drop my dog off at his kennel, but there was an issue because an employee had coronavirus. Apparently the kennel was moved to my old HS because my dog, on his retractable leash, found his way onstage during an early morning band concert. I had to pull him off by the leash. He was only in the back, so I think only one drummer saw him. Before that, my husband kept making me go outside with him. We lived in some kind of apartment where you have to swipe an Id to get in, and neither of us had that so we had to keep trying to piggy back on other door swipes to get back inside.

We were in a hilly town and waiting in queue and then we were doing a road trip through what looked like Dubai (but was apparently Srinagar, India) and more places in India.    On the way- we saw beautiful coasts/ beaches and water-sports were going on. There was a parasailing family that flew up because the boat got lifted (LOL).    Then we came back home and I realized I left my bike helmet in the rental- so we went back to pick it up. Bumped into my professor on the way who was not happy that everybody skipped the meeting.

23686S,"We were back in the little dark horrible house we rented while our new house was undergoing renovations. For whatever reason, in my dream that horrible house was not rented, but it was our niece's house. I was mad at her because there was a giant hole in the floor in the middle of the living room, and the dogs were at risk of falling there. She dismissed that possibility while one of the dogs fell in there and I had to rescue while arguing with my niece and pulling my dog from the head. While checking on the dog to see if she was ok, my other dog fell on the hole. I had to go down there and it was huge. Seen from the inside, it was like a cavern with many paths and ample rooms. Normally when I dream of exploring places, buildings, caverns, which are recurrent dreams for me, those are happy dreams. I enjoy exploring them and walking through unknown places in my dreams, but this time I was angry and worried. I picked up my dog and was handing her up to the living room when I saw at the end of one of the cavern corridors, someone in the dark.  I went to see who that was and I heard some voices like from a group of teenagers. They were making ""ghost sounds"" to try to scare me. I got very angry and went after them shouting and insulting them. They ran away. Back in the horrible house, my wife told me that we had to give our niece a birthday gift. I said I had nothing to give her so she took one of my notebooks to gift her. I said that was inappropriate because the notebook was not clean new. I remember reviewing the pages and seeing the written lines in them and the drafts and doodles. She said, it's only a few pages, it's almost clean! like it was not a great deal. I found it very annoying. That's all I remember.",,

10165S,"We were in the house in Maine, though of course it did not resemble the WL house or grounds. I was upstairs in the bedroom, having just woken up, looking out the window at the pond in the backyard. It was much larger and deeper than the pond in WL, and the water was perfectly clear, so I could easily see the creatures underneath.    At first I saw a few large eels, about three or four feet long. My husband had mentioned seeing eels, so I was excited to confirm his discovery. I wondered if we could fish them up to cook with, but they were so big, I thought that might be more eel meat than I knew what to do with. As I continued to look, I saw even larger eels, around ten feet long, and decided they were definitely too big.     Then in the further reaches of the pond I saw a *huge* fish-twenty feet long! And then I saw something even more extraordinary: it was a creature with a fish-like body, but with a tail and four distinct legs, walking across the bottom of the pond. The water must have been deep, because the creature was at least thirty feet long and fifteen feet high, but it didn't break the surface. Surrounding its body were membranous veils that waved gently in the water as it moved smoothly through the depths. What *was* it? I was reminded of the phrase Gandalf uses in LOTR: ""demon of the ancient world.""     I wanted to take pictures to confirm these astonishing observations, so I ran downstairs to grab my phone. Meanwhile I yelled to my husband, ""Come and see! Come and see!"" But when I got downstairs I could hear him on a call, so I knew he must be busy. Nevermind, I could at least get some pictures to show him later.     I ran back upstairs with my phone and tried to find a good place to take pictures. There was a screen in the window I had been originally looking through that impeded the focus, so I tried two more windows before I found one where I could take pictures through the glass without the added obstruction of a screen.     I could no longer see the huge underwater creature of a moment ago, but now I saw a large brown grizzly bear standing on its hind legs and apparently fighting an erect reptile of similar size. The reptile had a godzilla-like body with sharp white bony protrusions running down its head and spine.     Now my husband came upstairs to see what all the fuss was about. ""You were right about the eels,"" I told him. ""And-there some kind of 'demon of the ancient world' at the bottom of the pond-walking. I think it might be a dinosaur.""     My husband put on a quizzical expression and responded skeptically: ""Are you feeling alright? I mean, I've been down there pounding drinks, but...""   ""I know what I saw!"" I insisted. ""I came back to get a picture!""     At that point the alarm woke me up, and as my waking world came into focus, I initially felt disappointed by the realization that the magnificent creatures had been imaginary after all.   ",,

Something very similar happened in real life not too long ago - someone from the town came to the door to tell us they were paving the road and we needed to move our cars. We knew to expect this because they sent a letter beforehand.     So in the dream, the guy comes to the door. My mom is in the bathroom and my father is on the couch and they want me to answer the door, so I do and he says we're working out front. And I ask what he's doing and I see they are putting in a new brick path up to our house. They tore out the narrow stone path we have and they were putting a wider brick path next to the driveway.    I asked why they're doing this. (As in why are you doing this for free...we never called you or hired you.) and he was kind of sidestepping the question. The most he told me was that there were some new renters coming to the block, so the implications was they wanted all the nearby houses to look nice.    That was pretty much the end. It felt entirely plausible. Sometimes my dreams are more meandering and whimsical, sometimes they are just plainly realistic, or clearly inspired by things that happened in real life recently.",,

The other dream I remember began in a teacher's lounge where I discussed with another woman who Joe Biden would pick for VP, and how he'd use Elizabeth Warren if she wasn't VP (three of the people on my afternoon 4-hour Zoom call are teachers, though we didn't discuss politics yesterday). The dream changed and I was on a flying ship (maybe 18th-19th century) and I knew two sisters (late teens or early 20s) had been taken by the pirate captain / his crew (I'm not sure if I was part of the crew, the girls might have been stolen from the school). I was watching a clear corner space where a grouping of wine glasses of different shapes/sizes were steam-sanitized (but without any walls to the dishwashing apparatus), and I was concerned that the captain would break them at the stem (I didn't drink wine yesterday, there was a game my evening Google Hangouts group played where one question was into which cup of nine differently looking ones did we think poison was not put into). The older sister was going to be married to someone from the crew (possibly voluntarily?), and back on land I used the rope handrails (like you might find on a ship) to walk down the steep hill with lit candles in hurricane jars illuminating the walk to tell the crew member that she needed to be returned to her family, but no one was there. In the white bedroom tent at the bottom of the hill (which looked like a modern-day glamping tent, like something out of season 2 of the Netflix show You) and on the dresser there was something white - a feather or a scrap of paper - and I knew that it meant that the younger sister had stolen her sister (and possibly the sister's fiance?) back. The younger sister was and was not Mulan.",,
15740S,999,,
2908S,"When I woke up I remembered multiple different dreams. Now it's midnight. Two were about house fires, but they were ethanol fires, and ethanol burn with more or less invisible flames.  In the first dream, Dr Murphy from the TV show The Good Doctor, noticed an ethanol fire burning in the backyard (of my house), under the cedar tree near the fence line, but no one paid any attention to him because he's autistic. By the time they believed him, the fire had spread significantly. The next scene I still remember was inside a house, like a lower basement, and there was ""regular"" fire there, and the two female firefighters from the tv show Station 19 were there, telling two people in their rooms to evacuate, but the people in the rooms were in an argument with the peopel trying to help them and wouldn't come out of their rooms. The fire was spreading, and they were running out of time to evacuate. As the fire intensified the firefighters had to flee. Then someone was outside, cutting a hole in the wall, with a saw, so the people who were trapped inside wouldn't burn alive and could escape.   At this point, the dream was disturbing enough to wake me up, and I was shaken up enough that I it took me a while to fall back asleep.  Then I had another ethanol fire dream! Again, the two female firefighters (Andy & Maya) from the tv show Station 19 were there, and again they were in my backyard, but the other side of the yard this time -by the apricot tree. Andy was hurt, and loaded into a sled like what's used to bring an injured person down a ski slope. There was another injured person, who was evacuated first, with one person lifting each end of the sled, and carrying them to safety. I was left with Andy, and I was securing her sled, like the stop of shoe laces. Her feet were closest to me, & her head closest to the fire, so I was working as fast as I could to finish before the fire burned her head. I had to stop pull the sled away from the fire and then finish. I couldn't wait for someone else to come help me carry her sled, because the fire was too intense, so I pulled it, dragging it behind me. The path through the yard leads to a wide gate, but there was a wall of blue fire about thigh high at the gate. I was in firefighter gear, so I could have walked through it and been ok, but Andy was ground level, so she would have gone through it, with her face unprotected, and she said, ""Do NOT take me through there."" So I had to look for another way out. We have a narrow gate in the back, so I pulled her through there. Once we were out we were safe.  There was another dream that took place in Australia, out in the country, in the highlands. Something about the accents in that region. Maybe a visit to small shop on a farm. (I don't remember that one so well anymore.)  The last dream I remember took place during the Covid pandemic, but it was the holidays and people were trying to do Christmas shopping. It was like going to grocery stores today; some people in masks, some in gloves, some in neither. I went into a one room store I'm familiar with, but I touched something with one hand before putting on my second glove, so I went looking for the bathroom to wash my hands. (I was using the same washable gloves I'm using now in real life.) But the inside of the store had changed;instead of being one big room, it was like a department store, with many rooms, and a cement stairwell with fire doors, and I couldnt' find the bathroom, and the more I looked for it, the more people passed me within 6ft and I was being exposed to their vaporous germ clouds. I ended up in a room full of giant stuffed animals for children lining all the shelves against the walls. I think from there I was able to see the windows to know which way to go to get out of the store. I think I left without buying anything.",,

There is a carved, unique, tall (about 18 inches ),wooden, narrow jewelry box that I push under a table to get it out of the way and perhaps to hide it while we are out. There is a very large suitcase on the bed..Nnot ours. But someone is showing that it has all sorts of compartments. I'm thinking maybe we should buy one (or it) because we could consolidate everything into just one bag. I do privately think that it is probably too large but it is an amazing piece of luggage. My husband would have to handle it however. He objects that it would be too much,even for him, to carry and maneuver. I wonder if it has wheels. There is discussion about who has already seen the play, surprise by someone younger that we'd go see a play with Avril Lavigne. Of note that in real life, none of us are people who go to live theater, so all of this is unusual. Also of note, that even though we are in our 70's, we have always listened to current music and are familiar with what's popular. Often, more so than our kids and grandkids.

1059S,"Woke up from stress dream around 07:30 - I was in the office (this is my third week working exclusively from home, and it wasn't my real office). I was sitting next to a co-worker (who in real life my cube is behind; I spoke with him on Tuesday for the first time since WFH, though we've IM'd a few times - IRL he's the person I chat with in the office most, and I've missed him and my other work friends In real life there). There was a case that I should have finished on Tuesday that I haven't reviewed yet. In the dream, I received a first, and then a second email from the financial advisor on the case with the subject line of 'silence, silence, silence' (though in the dream it was because I'd already approved the application but then hadn't responded to the additional information submitted by the financial advisor yet; in real life I'd had a somewhat similar appeal case recently, although the subject line of the follow up emails differed; I do really need to wrap up the case the dream was about this morning). In the dream, there was also a meeting invite when I logged in regarding this case (with someone who, in the dream, was in management, although in real life he's not in my department, and I almost never directly work with him). When I called into the meeting invite, I was speaking to someone other than the person who sent the meeting invite or the financial advisor (though his name was someone I recognized in the dream as another financial advisor, just not one I know in real life) and the case review was able to be wra6pper up without incident.    I had a second dream after I went back to sleep about I was with some friends somewhere (maybe a college campus, though not one I think I've ever been to on real life) for a weekend lecture series about something (maybe Jane Austen?). It was a group of maybe 6-7 of us, and for some reason as the lecture was about to get started, I knew that at least two of my friends weren't going to make it to the lecture, so I left the room to go look for them. Once outside (the doors were like subway doors, once the doors closed, you could sometimes leave, but usually couldn't get back in), I saw that the missing friends were inside the lecture room, just sitting in a different part of the room. I felt bad because I'd convinced another friend that I'm closest to of the dream group to leave to find the others. We returned to where we were staying, an Airbnb, yet inside there were some pictures on the wall that were supposed to be from a guy friend of a friend (who was able to stay for the lecture).  We were sitting in a front living room, and the mail came - it was a delivery of some sort that a second guy friend-of-my-friend wanted to open. He also asked the group if we could also open/eat the two boxes to pizza that had been delivered earlier that had been left outside because the Airbnb homeowner must have ordered it. In talking with the first guy friend-of-my-friend about the pictures of my alma mater and family cabin on the wall, first guy said he'd been to those places. I also recognized some other of his pictures as of a private high school, though he said they were from a different private high school than I'd guessed. I felt a slightly strange suspicious that he had a photo of my family cabin, but stranger that he'd been to the terrace (an open-to-the-public portion of the student Union if my alma mater). I texted him asking why he had those pictures (which looked like ones I've taken in real life), and he responded asking if I really wanted to know.",,
