"I had a dream where I was entered into an experiment without my knowledge.  In this experiment, every door in the world took you to an alternate universe.  It was extremely scary.  The first door took me to an Australian man's home, he kept many different exotic animals as pets, such as ostriches, giraffes, snakes, and crocodiles.  I went through a few more doors, ending up in crazy locations, before ending up in a lab, where I met up with my younger brother who also somehow got involved in the experiment.  We were also joined by another teenager who was unaware of the experiment, but tagged along with us anyways.  We later noticed strange behavior from him, before eventually concluding he was one of the evil scientists involved in the creation of the experiment.  We narrowly escaped him and then I woke up."
I was at a party with a bunch of friends and we were surrounded by a fence and there was a house party and then a giant explosion and barrels flew everyone and I jumped to save my friend and then everyone started getting electrocute and I unplugged a cord and everything stopped.
"I had a dream that i saved a cat. It was hurt and frail, probably hungry as well. The biggest thing i remember was the cats fur being bald, bloody, and sad. I took the cat home and fed it and kept it."
I was on a skiing trip and was going down the alps. The snow was cold and fluffy and the air felt crisp.
"This dream started out with me running away from someone. I never got a good look at the person so I dont know what he looked like, however I knew it was a guy from an organization. I dont know why they were after me, the only thing I knew was that I had information they wanted. So I ran from them. I somehow knew parkour to easily maneuver out of their traps and being cornered. I remember jumping on and over hard pointy fences, rolling in soft grass when I hit the ground, and how fast I was at moving compared to these agents who were trying to catch me. They were never armed because they wanted me alive to get the information so they never shot anything besides blow darts which I easily avoided. From how fast I moved and avoided things I could decipher that I was probably an agent of a different organization then the one hunting me. I hid in cities, homes, and vehicles to travel but they always found me and we were in a footed chase again. Either that or I was fighting someone but it was mostly me avoiding them. after the fourth time of avoiding these agents I woke up."
"I was eating at a McDonalds with this really hot blonde chick and for some reason in the she kept on making eye contact with these two dudes at two bar type seats while we were in a booth right next to them. One of them was talking about the ice cream cone they got and the random blonde chick went up and asked if she could have a lick. The guy tells her yes that she can and so she took a lick of his ice cream cone. After like 3-4 licks of the dudes ice cream cone she said thank you and out of no where looks at him for like 3 seconds and proceeds to move her face closer and closer to his face to then eventually full on making out with him in the middle of McDonalds with me watching the hot blonde chick that was supposedly with me make out with this other dude. I being completely shocked proceeded to run out of the McDonalds to find myself in the middle of one of those giant bush mazes where the bushes go up like 20-30 feet. So not thinking straight I just run right into the random bush maze that had many different pathways to take not knowing that. I still being blown away by my hot blonde girl doing that to me did not even think to consider where I was headed. I ran into every dead end possible in that maze that I completely lost faith in getting out of the maze. After like 15 minutes, I saw a little bit of open space ahead of me. Thinking I finally came to the end of the maze I ran as fast as I could. Once I finally got there I could not believe what I saw. I saw the same McDonalds! This time though it seemed different. I went inside the McDonalds and I saw a random dude on the date with a hot blonde girl. Then I eventually saw one of my best friends sitting at a stool type seat next to them sitting in a booth with two ice cream cones. I started getting into a conversation with him about tubing at the lake and then the girl that was on a date with the guy stood up and looked towards me and asked for a lick of my ice cream cone. Then I woke up unfortunately."
My whole family were aliens and I was creeped out.
"I had a bag of pizza and i guess i wanted to see what would happen if i put grasshopper in the bag for a certain period of time. So i had so so many grasshoppers in the ziploc bag with the pizza that it wouldnt close and i can remember feeling the crunch and how the bag felt. I remembering dropping the bag cause it was so full and them spilling out. Then i made someone else pick up the bag cause i was disgusted and scared, there were very few left and they zipped it up. Thats all i remember"
I cant describe the dream in detail now.
I had a dream that my family gave my dog to my uncle (my dog past away a few months ago) and my uncle gave him tatoos. I remember feeling super sad.

All my friends came to visit me at KU
I had a dream that my brother was on heavy drugs and I went to go help him and I was extremely scared.
I had a dream that me and my roommate had adopted a puppy and were hiding it in my dorm. We were in our cozy two person dorm but the dog was being too loud and had to go outside and I was scared people would find out. My point of view was that i had to protect the dog and keep it safe. I was scared of my RA and neighbors. We got the dog for free while volunteering at the dog shelter. It was a small pomeranian and it was very energetic. We were trying to train it to hide.
"I was sitting down and had a puppy. The puppy was black and white, it had curly hair, and it was soft. I felt happy and I wanted to take the puppy home."
"Went to Texas to visit my best friend and hung out with her and her friends at Baylor. Then we went to a Gracie Abrams concert, that was in a house made out of all wood. The house had no furniture, just empty with a balcony. Gracie Abrams snapped me before the concert and asked if I knew someone, and I said yes. At the concert she came to me and talked to me."
Me and my friends in this school that looked kind of like Hogwarts. We jumped into a lake through a hole in some ice and became dolphins. Then as we swam deeper and were able to become mermaids. I remember being cold and stressed and had a hard time breathing when I was underwater. Then when we came back to school Idina Menzel sang defying gravity to us.
I was going for a walk on campus and everything was as normal and then the sky turned dark red and after that I woke up.
"Had a dream about my ACCT exam. I dreamed that I was in the exam room in budig, it was hot, smelled musty, and packed to the brim with people. Everyone was frantic and I was super nervous. I hadn't studied much, was sweating a lot and had high anxiety. Over the next hour, my dream showed me struggling to answer the questions, with me ending up guessing on most of the questions. Then the dream fast forwards to my lab, showing me that I had failed the exam. This dream made me feel very scared about the exam and highlighted my internal feelings."
"I had a dream on the night of the election that Trump was elected. I was happy. Many others were happy too, so there was cheering in the background. In my dream Kamala was upset about her loss and starting to film a child who had been injured and laughed almost in a way that made her feel better about herself."
I got back with my boyfriend from 2 years ago and we were at this park and that was in my home town. It was the first time we had talked in like a year but everything was back to normal.
"I had a dream one night where I was seeing the dream through my own eyes. I was in a house on the staircase with my ex boyfriend. I loved him very much and the breakup was pretty messy, so in the dream I was confused why he was smiling at me. I asked if loved me and he responded with ""How could I not love you? You're the best thing that ever happened to me."" When I heard that in the dream I started crying and hugged him. It felt like a relief because in the dream I knew he did not hate me."
"My dream took place in a big old house that reminded me of my childhood home. In this dream many of my family members were there, including immediate and extended family, as well as relatives that have passed away. In my dream I was a few years younger, and I was able to see it all from my point of view. My parents had to decided to sell the family house and I seemed to be the only one who was sad about it. My first ever dog, that has also passed away, was there and you could tell it was her time to go as well. I was sitting in my room reminiscing and crying about leaving my childhood home, but no one else seemed to care. They were all ready to move on and move out, but I was still stuck in the past. The dream felt very real, and somewhat relatable to past real life situations."
"My grandma was taken by bad guys to an island outside of the city. My mother, father, and I had to rescue her from draco malfoy. We had to take a helicopter we stole from the island to save my grandma."
me and my roommate sleep on high lofted beds. one night in my dream the room started filling up slowly with water and every window and door slammed shut and around 5 locks appeared on each door. In order to escape we had to answer a certain question to unlock each lock. The last lock's question was einsteins riddle and we somehow solved it and escaped the room. That's when I woke up.
"I had a dream that I was in Florida during the hurricane, and my boyfriend and his dad came to pick me up and we drove 20+ hours back to Missouri. It was stressful and weird that it was my boyfriend not my own family. I don't remember the drive itself but I do remember how scared we all were and we all kept looking back and I don't remember why."
"I had a dream that I drove to Disney World from Overland Park with my ex-boyfriend. I was the actor, not an observer the whole dream. In the dream, the RV smelled like cigarettes and looked like it was from the 1990s. He was driving while I was in the back playing Lady Gaga. He's yelling at me to change the music. He still has a tan from summer, but I am super pale, so I am excited to be in Florida. When we got there, we rode a rollercoaster and ate funnel cake with way too much powdered sugar. The song ""Mad at Disney"" from TikTok was playing and we kept fighting about what ride to go on next. I wasn't very upset because it was more play-fighting than anything."
I was at Aldi the morning their advent calendars came out i was the second person in line and got to go in early they hadn't opened yet no workers were there but the doors were open so I went in. It was cold and foggy outside almost dewy rainy. I went to the back of the store to where the advent calendars were i climbed on the shelves because I am very short to see the ones o top in the back to find the one i wanted which was the candle one. I couldn't find it and started to worry I was int he wrong spot and was going to be gone when I figured it out. Everyone around me was grabbing what they wanted making me more anxious. I was loud with all the voices and a worker came over and I asked her for help to find the one i wanted. She said they didn't get that one in that week. I was so upset I had been looking forward to getting it for a week or so.
"I was an actor. I was in my place of working, which is a nursing home so it was like apartments. I had just seen my friends outside of the window and watched them walk into a frat house. I decided to leave my work and join them in the frat house. They then called the cops on me which led me to feeling super upset. the cops then followed me back to my work and a fight broke out between them and it was super scary. the friends ended up apologizing but i could not forgive them."
"i was in the woods with my father and we were standing next to an old 70's beat up bronco that my grandpa has, all of a sudden i look up toward the roof of the car and there is a doe standing there and i felt immense dread. it felt as if everything blacked out for a moment then i opened my eyes again and the doe had turned into a buck and was now charging tword me angrily, i felt justified in my dread and anxiety but wasn't reacting in and anxious or scared manor, i was just trying to hold it back by the antlers. I then hear my dad say ""just show it whose boss"" (like whose dominant) and i was suddenly a foot taller and the buck was now the size of a medium sized dog and had flipped it to its side and it had submitted to me the was a dog would. i immediately felt better and lost my feelings of anxiety, then i woke up."
I was camping out for the KU basketball game in Allen Fieldhouse. 16 groups got crossed off in front of us during roll call. I was very excited because I knew that we would get into the game earlier and get better seats.
"In a dream I had the other night, I was walking down a busy city with tall buildings. When I was walking, I realized that one of the buildings was falling over on top of me and I ran to that building. While I was running to that building, the weather outside turned dark, and it was raining. I started pushing the building back up and yelling at everyone to get out of the ways. Then I woke up, and I was actually pushing my bedroom wall. So I was sleepwalking. That's all that I can remember."
"In my dream i was trained to be a hunter with my family, i went through a series of rooms where i stopped inside what looked like to be an old jail holding place. I found a bow and arrow sitting on one of the walls and then a voice out of no where instructed me to shoot any mice that i found running around. Then as i look behind me i see my dad pick up another bow and arrow and he shoots the arrow at one of the light bulbs then thats when the dream ended and i woke up."
"I was in the city of Lawerence, but my grandparents house was here. It was a nightmare. There was a man in their house that came in while we were just relaxing and watching TV together, and he was mad at me for some personal reason and he had a gun. There was some random person who tackled him and I just remember running to hide and then I woke up. It was scary and really weird. It was from my own perspective the whole time. There was peace in the dream and then anxiety, stress, and fear."
"In this dream I woke up in the Taekwondo school that I work at. I remember being confused as to why I was there. Then I remember going up to my boss and talking to him. I saw the mats, seating area, and the office where my boss was. After I talked to him I went to my car and drove home to hang out with my friends. Then after that in my dream I was in my room for some reason I took a pregnancy test and found out I was pregnant. Then after that I woke up and was really confused"
"I had a dream that there was a poisonus rattle snake in my hair and it bit me. I was in bed, and my head was curly, and it was nestled in it. I felt scared and terrified."
"I was at my coworker's house named Carl. He is about 32 I think, and he had a brain injury when he was younger where he can only move one side of his body. He told me in real life that after going through a lot of physical therapy he can walk and talk but cant move his right arm and it is stuck as a ""claw"". He creeps me out at work because he is always yelling my name across the registers so that I talk to him and he used to always ask me how old I was and where I lived. In the dream I was visiting his house because he wanted to hang out and I ended up staying the night for some reason even though I was very uncomfortable with it. He tried pressuring me into sex and I couldn't figure out how to get away. I was panicking and telling him no while he was trying to take pictures of me. His family came over and so he had to leave the room and I walked downstairs pretending nothing happened because I didn't want to worry his parents. They thought it was weird that I was there and obviously knew that I stayed the night because I was wearing pajamas. I was a little cold because the house was big with tile floors. Because it was such a big house I didn't know where to go so that I could leave and I started feeling more and more nervous. Usually I realize I am in a dream and I wake myself up which is what I think I did that night. My POV in the dream was a mix of 3rd person and 1st person. Sometimes I would be in my position interacting with Carl or something and then I would be looking down watching myself walking around the house."
"My dream took place at what my brain believed to be Naismith but was actually a hotel castle that I couldn't find the front doors to, as I was walking around there I transported to a tropical environment and felt as though I was on vacation. My friends were inside playing pool but when I was trying to find them I was pulled into a family tour where it felt like a Disney cruise commercial. As I walked into one of the hotel rooms with this family I was hit by a swirling of colors which were pink and purple mostly. The entrance to the hotel was cave light and there was a talking barbie doll greeting us. Then the lights went away and I was stuck with a smaller non-living barbie doll that felt ominous."
"I was jumping from place to place and scenario to scenario, but they all made me feel stressed and anxious. By the way, I was lucid dreaming and knew that I was dreaming the entire time. Now back to the dream. I was at first ""woken"" from my sleep even though I was still dreaming and was running late to work and had overslept and missed my alarm. I get dressed as quickly as I could and felt like I almost teleported to work. While at work I kept feeling this uneasiness as if I was missing something. Work continued until it hit me that I had an assignment due from my chemistry class and for some reason had an exam. The setting then abruptly shifts and I am now in the exam room of gray little taking an exam over equilibrium constants, acids and bases, etc. As I'm looking at these questions, there's information missing as if they're almost a blurry film over them. I begin to panic as I don't understand what I'm looking at and can't answer the questions. There's then this nagging feeling that I need to wake up, for context I have work in morning at 7am and I feel like I'm oversleeping, so I all of sudden jolt awake and see that it's 4:30am and that I haven't overslept. I then fall back asleep and didn't have any vivid dream I could remember."
"I was living in a school-based apartment, right next to the school, and next to the school was a mental hospital where people are known to jump out from. One day when walking through the halls of school, I looked out the window and saw a girl on top of the roof, sitting down and swinging her feet. She was looking at me, then got up and jumped. I ran straight downstairs to make sure she was already. When I got to the parking lot, I had to push through a lot of people to see what was happening; she was dead. I was close enough to see her body, and she was staring at me, then got up and ran to me, but I was the only person who could see it. The ambulance took her body away. She began to haunt me, follow me everywhere, and I couldn't figure out why."
"I recently had a dream that I was forced to have sex in front of an audience, got pregnant with an unwanted baby, and then tried to terminate the pregnancy by inserting a wire coat hanger inside myself. I was terrified, it was so embarrassing and involved so much blood. I didn't feel the pain or sensation or having sex however."
"I recently had a dream that my boyfriend had broken up with me. We had been hanging out just the two of us, I think we went shopping and had lunch then came back to my apartment. While we were there he was like ""I think we should see other people/go our separate ways"" and I remember being okay with it at first, but then I switched, and I was very upset and asking him why over and over. I remember begging almost, and he was just like packing his stuff up and leaving without giving me an explanation as to why he wanted to break up. I like chased him downstairs and all of our friends were there. His best friend was there specifically and was like ""bro why are you doing this"" to my boyfriend. And then the door to my apartment opened and it was like bright and sunny, and we were in like a Walmart parking lot. And then I woke up."
"The dream started with my girlfriend and me in bed in a studio apartment we want to rent watching the musical Nerdy Prudes Must Die by Starkids on youtube. It felt really comforting to be around her as we have been long distance for a few months now. Then I think it was during The Woods part of NPMD that we were just suddenly in the musical. We ran from Max who was the reanimated dead bully from the show. It was weird though because after that we hid in the audience as the summoning scene went on. Then I was in my dorm alone watching the news and it said that the election was void and there was another one but we then again lost to trump. Then a bomb dropped on Kansas but like it was the size of the state of Kansas. 
I am sorry I don't really remember more specific details it is kind of a blur."
"I was in my high school cafeteria for a small portion of the dream, but I could sort of fly by jumping around and getting almost ""stuck"" in the air. It was more like a suspended jump, but my direction and movement speed was very limited. I went upstairs into one of the classrooms and got into a small argument with a teacher I am not fond of, and my sister appeared into the room. My sister passed away several years ago, and once I saw her I was snapped out of the fiction of the dream and focused on her presence. She seemed to ignore that I was reacting to her presence strangely, and instead followed the plot of the dream like normal."
there was this goat but its leg was bent and then the villain in my dream (who was a character from 13 reasons why) killed the goat with garlic and then i was in a lecture that was taken over by a new professor because the old one was the guy who killed the goat. and my best friends brother jumped off of a building and my best friend came to visit me but i was on a bus with other girls from her high school softball team.
"I had a dream where I was entering a library to study for my classes. I walked into a room, thinking that it was welcome to everyone. Once I sat down, I felt like I was not supposed to be there. This made me feel anxious and nervous. I felt people staring at me and was paranoid that they were judging me for being there. There was a person in charge assigning everyone directions and coaching everyone. Everyone kept working. I sat there frozen because I felt paralyzed from my anxiety. I tried to go along with it and act like I was typing on my computer like everyone else. I was still confused at this point, but once everyone started to walk out of the room I left with the crowd and realized what happened. I walked into a room where there was a ""study group"" and everyone who was in the room was receiving extra credit for a class. Then the group walked outside into a lobby. A woman was handing out snacks and offered me one first. I accepted it and thanked her, but was still confused. It was gelatin based food that she said had several health benefits. She gave me two servings. After I finished it, I noticed that no one else ate it. Then, another person in charge of the group asked if there was enough  for everyone. I overheard her say this and was more confused. Someone answered her and said yes, but just one for everyone. People kept staring at me and one person who I recognized laughed at me. Then I woke up."
"It’s a story about me accompanying a girl who looks like Roxy Migurdia. It revolves around the entire world that is slowly being heated up, melting all icy parts of the world. This is a problem because Roxy is a part of a clan that can only survive in the cold. So the whole journey is getting her to colder and colder areas with an RV as they all gradually melt behind us. We also have enhanced physical strength, speed and jumping capability to jump from ice cap to ice cap. At some point we reach the final ice cap and we know it’s melting slowly but I act as if everything is fine but Roxy knows it’s not, so she steps out of her RV onto the thinning ice and let’s it melt, falling into the ocean to eventually drown but telling me to go back to land and that it’s unfortunate how life was like this. After this I had a memory of bringing Roxy to regular land at some point using an Ice suit when we were children. I would spend fun time with her over years with this method but as I matured, I would notice her getting bullied ruthlessly for her race; I would watch and not do anything and sometimes egg it on. I feel intense guilt washing over me as Roxy dies and I wake up."
"I was a photographer for a recital at my former dance studio. I remember feeling stressed and trying to do my best and get all the right angles. I was sort of running around backstage and then I saw my ex-boyfriend's little sister whom I was very close to. I knew I would see her mom eventually, so I got very anxious and scared to see her. After that I turned the corner and saw her mom and she hugged me. I was disappointed in her because of how her son treated me and sort of resented her. I also felt awkward because I don't like hugs it didn't really matter that it was from her."
"I was walking through a dense forest in the middle of the night, with fog hanging low over the ground, so thick I could barely see my feet. The air was cold and damp, and every now and then, I’d feel a faint breeze against my face. There was this eerie silence, broken only by the crunch of leaves underfoot. I remember feeling both lost and strangely calm, like I knew I had somewhere to be but wasn’t in a hurry."
"I went back home for break and in the dream and i felt like I was awake but i couldn't move my body. I watched as all of my lifes important events played out. And then i started to be transformed into different places all with the soul purpose of waking up. After I got out of one place, I would go into another. This took a while to wake up. The dreams consisted of getting into a fight with my parents, having to slay dragons, relive moments with people I'm not friends with anymore. I then started to wake up in different parts on my house, but couldn't actually wake up till I was in the exact place I was in. Then i heard my dads voice, he was asking me to go to a restaurant with him. I anxiously hopped to every place I could think of. I finally arrived to the place I feel asleep in. I imagined that I ran to the car and got in last minute. Finally in the car, my dad turns to me and says ""you are still dreaming"" and then I actually woke up."
"I saw the KU campus and many people that I am close with, I felt a personal connection to each person that I recognized. It was almost as if I was an observer that was watching my interaction with my friends. The only thing notably different about the campus was that it was night outside and the stars were super bright."
"I had a dream that my boyfriend broke up with me. It was weird because he’s one of the sweetest people I know. He became rude and then ended it but he still wanted to hangout. I felt very hurt and it felt real. when I woke up I was so relieved. During the dream I was devastated but somewhat soon before it ended I realized I was dreaming but I was still asleep. Even though I knew it was a dream a bit before, It was still nice to wake up to confirm it wasn’t real. it made me feel anxious and heartbroken. I think I had this dream because I took melatonin, I tend to have nightmares every time I take it."
I had a dream that I owned a taco shop
"I was on my couch in my living room with a woman whom i had just met in real life. I was very attracted to her and we were having a great night. When we began to kiss, something changed and my roommates, who were not home in the beginning all arrived with several friends and interrupted my time with this girl. When we went into my room to avoid the commotion, there was a large amount of marijuana in the room that we began to smoke until the smoke filled the room and caused an issue. We heard sirens and a knock at the door and police came in the room and arrested everyone except me and the girl escaped onto the ledge of the window. My heart was racing and I felt adrenaline like nothing before. We managed to find a car and break into it and drove away with the police chasing us. I then realized that no matter what I did my life was over and I felt this overwhelming sense of dread and depression. I now had nothing but this girl whom I resented for ruining my life and tried to crash the car or drive off the road, but it just bounced off the walls and we could not stop driving. I was depressed and wanted it to be over and could not stop the feeling of fear and anxiety."
"I find myself standing on the edge of a vast, tranquil lake. The surface of the water is perfectly still, reflecting the sky above like a mirror. The air is warm, and the scent of flowers and fresh grass fills my lungs with every breath. The sun is low on the horizon, casting a soft, golden glow over everything, turning the water into liquid light. I feel a deep sense of peace here, like time itself has slowed down.

I take a step forward, my feet sinking slightly into the soft earth beneath me. The sound of the water lapping gently at the shore fills the air, and I feel drawn to it, almost as if the lake is calling me. Without thinking, I slip off my shoes and step into the water. It's cool and refreshing, the sensation sending a shiver up my spine as I wade deeper, the water rippling around my legs.

As I walk further, I notice something unusual—a large, smooth stone rising out of the lake, like a natural platform. It’s perfectly round, covered in moss and small flowers. Intrigued, I make my way toward it, the water barely reaching my knees now. The stone feels warm under my feet as I step onto it, and I sit down, gazing out across the lake. The stillness is comforting, the world around me soft and full of possibility.

Suddenly, a soft light appears on the horizon, growing brighter as it comes closer. It’s not like the sun, but something else—shimmering and ethereal, like a star falling from the sky. It hovers just above the water, casting gentle beams of light across the surface. I watch in awe, feeling no fear, only wonder. The light moves toward me, and as it does, the water beneath it begins to glow in response.

Then, something shifts—slowly, almost imperceptibly—and I realize I’m no longer alone. A figure materializes from the light, their shape ethereal, but undeniably present. They are tall, dressed in flowing robes of soft white and gold, their face glowing but unformed, as if it’s not quite meant to be seen. But I can feel their presence deeply, like they’ve always been a part of me.

The figure steps closer, and as they do, a sense of understanding washes over me. It’s not through words, but through a knowing. They reach out, their hand hovering just in front of mine. I hesitate for only a moment before I take it. The moment my fingers brush theirs, I feel a surge of warmth—a warmth that spreads through me, filling me with peace and clarity. The figure’s presence is grounding, yet freeing, and I realize that they are both guiding me and reminding me of something I’ve always known.

Without speaking, they gesture toward the glowing water, and I look down. The surface is now a canvas, a swirling tapestry of colors and patterns—images of moments from my past, my present, and even glimpses of what might be. The water shows me the path I’ve walked, and the path that lies ahead, shifting and changing with every glance.

The figure nods once, as if to say, ""You’re on the right path. Trust what you see, trust what you feel."" Then, as quietly as they came, the figure begins to fade back into the light, leaving me with the lake, the warmth, and a newfound sense of direction.

I stay on the stone, my fingers still tingling from the touch, and watch as the light dissolves into the sky. The lake, now calm and clear again, reflects the stars as night falls. I feel a deep sense of peace, as if I’ve just been given a gift I didn’t know I needed. I stand slowly, taking one last look at the serene water before I turn and walk back along the shore, feeling lighter, like something inside me has shifted into place.

"Im standing at the edge of a jungle. There is an opening to a path, I follow it to find a wide open area with lots of stars. There is also a bridge that looks sketchy and I cross it to end up falling into a trap, I have to navigate through a maze to escape the trap. At the end, I find a treasure chest of gold."
"I had never broken up with my ex boyfriend that cheated on me and we were sitting in my living room together. the sun was very bright, we were laughing a lot and very touchy and happy. He was very loving and I felt really safe and happy with him."
"I was in prison, but it was separated into different areas, I never remember being transferred but I was in the different areas throughout the dream. The first one was a woman's only area, but I was an outsider because they knew I was a man, there were no rooms the beds were all out in the open with 2 levels in the hall. I remember going to the bathroom and someone seeing me stand while peeing and that's when I realized I was in the women's prison. Then some of the people stayed the same but it felt like I was in juvie, everyone was younger but they were all still dangerous. One crazy kid was arguing with me and tensions were getting high, when another kid came from behind him and sliced his neck open with a knife, folded the knife threw it over my head to someone watching who then threw it at me, I let it hit my chest and drop to the floor and I walked away out of instinct to get away from the scene. I am not sure how I escaped but I did, I may have been released, but on the way out it seemed like we went into the future I remember seeing a bunch of highways and thinking it looked like Blade Runner. Then we went to this gas station but it was huge and there were a few other ex-inmates in their clothes still like I was. Everything was chill and I was walking back to the car but I felt like I was getting chased so I hurried up and sure enough I was so I ran to the car got in but when I was sitting in the car safe the man in his inmate clothes still reached through the window like It wasn't there and stabbed me. But I never died."
I was at a party with my friends. The floors were wooden and the air was clear. People were dancing and having fun. Everyone was talking and there was karaoke going on in the background.
"i was in in college but it wasn't the same dorm i'm in now, i was rooming with multiple people, a friend i made in class, my brother and other girls. I guess my brother didn't have a room or a bed to sleep in while we were in the process of setting everything up so this one girl like helped him and i don't know why i was so mad but i guess i pushed like the bottom of a bed on her and it fell on her and i jumped on it like 2 times making her bleed really bad, and then after i thought i killed her but i didn't and i think that was the rest of the dream. It was a really weird dream i don't know if it's because i was watching a lot of horror movies previously but it scared me a bit for how agressive i was"
I was playing hockey with a ball instead of a puck from the point of view of a different person who actually knew how to play for about 10 seconds and that is all that I remember.
"In my dream, I was being chased by the guy who sexually assaulted me. He was white, around 160 lbs with curly brown hair and brown eyes. I looked around me and saw my favorite flowers, tulips, of all different colors. As I was running, I tripped and he got on top of me. It was as if I was watching it in his eyes. When it was all over, I got up and started running back towards my house crying."
I was in an office building and stopped a shooting from happening
"In this dream, which occurred last night, I was at the E.R. and was required to complete a urine sample. After peeing in the cup the doctor eventually came back in and told my I was pregnant. This was to complete shock of mine, and elevated my heart rate extremely. I was frightened and very upset about this discovery. I remember freaking out about this news, however what I remember from the dream ends there."
In my most recent dream was with an old friend and we went to an Italian restaurant (olive garden) on a snowy day to which we were eating she no longer was speaking english. She was speaking in gibberish to me and whenever I would pretend I knew what she was saying she would get extremely mad but when I would respond in gibberish she was happy and eager to continue the conversation. I felt very uneasy and dumb feeling as if I didn't understand my friend. Me and my friend were both dressed up nicely but our waiter was dressed as a clown for some reason but a nice clown.
I was at an antique store with my high school friends and then somehow I saw my friends baby pictures.
There was this party and basically my friends and I kept having to hide from someone and we just kept doing that for the majority of the dream. I felt anxious but also excited as it was kind of like a game. It seemed as if it was Christmas party as there were warm colored white lights and red lights.
I was stuck on a cruise ship
"I never really smell or touch anything when I dream, and I can never remember things all the way. My dream was about my old cross country teammates from high school and in real life they recently went to a really large meet up in South Dakota. In the dream I remember talking to two of my teammates, Alli and Sammie about how their race went. Sammie is shorter with thin wavy dark hair and lots of freckles, and Alli is tall with long legs and brown hair that has been dyed blonde. Both of them said that their races went well, and then that they had a lot to catch me up on since I had last seen them. Then another teammate of mine, Isaac came over. Sammie and Isaac are dating, and I just found this out last week, they told me this in the dream. Isaac is very tall with long arms and legs and he has curly brown hair that was originally straight but he had it permed. After telling me that they were dating Isaac then told me that another teammate of mine, one who is not in high school anymore was in the hospital again. His name is Jacob, he is of medium height with dark hair and he has had his lung collapse in the past. This is what happened again in the dream, and then suddenly we were all in a hospital room with Jacob, and he was okay but upset it had happened again. Then I was very confused and woke up."

Jacob has been in the hospital before due to his lung collapsing. He is medium height with brown hair. We suddenly were all in his hospital room where he was fine, however he was upset that this had happened to him again. Then I was confused and woke up."
I remember when I was running around a basketball gym trying to get away from a serial killer. It was a basketball tournament going on and a lot of people were there.
I had a dream that a trex took the roof off my house and I was there with my childhood best friend we randomly teleported to my grandma's house and I was eating cereal and then I was at the park behind my house. I don't know what this even means but I woke up really stressed out from it.
I was myself and I was with my cousins on this lake front property and I got in an ATV and was driving to some fast food on the property with my girlfriend when I saw a big tortoise cross the road it was yellowsih. So then I was a little spooked and then when we got out to go get food I saw a skunk so I jumped back in the ATV then my girlfriend was driving and she went down this super steep hill and took a turn right by the water and the ATV tipped over and went into the lake we both escaped the ATV rather easily so my girl friend swam to the shore while I took a kayak(?) out of the water and onto the shore and I was moving to go try and get the ATV out but then it was still in drive and drove straight up the hill by itself and all the sudden it was night and super dark so I was worried I might lose it so I was chasing after it when a mother was warning her kid to stay close to her I turned on a big flash light to see the ATV but that made the mom and the kid angry and they chased after me. And then I woke up
I got to play with my dead dog that died awhile ago and it made me really happy
Some of my teachers were fighting about the election results
"In the dream, I was an actor at a club somewhere and the cast of Good Luck Charlie was there. They wanted to take pictures with me but had to get to the front of the stage when I had general admission passes as opposed to VIP passes."
I was in a race car and I was racing then then I crossed the finish line about to get my trophy and then I woke up
"I was a lumberjack who was running through a heavily wooded area. It was the middle of the night. Then I remember running up to a brick building, and then going inside. It then transitioned into a sort of mall on a pier. There were two people with me, friends. There a large man sort of cartoonishly proportioned wearing a black blazer and fedora. The other was a small rat-ish looking man. I was arguing with them. I think we were there looking for something. Then suddenly another group of people appeared and we fought. After the fight was finished I consoled one of the fallen."
"There was a younger version of me and my grandfather and we were fishing at a park that I have been to a couple times. However, the strange thing was that we weren't fishing in water, it was molten lava. I don't know why it wasn't water, but that's just how it was. It was mostly a 3rd person point of view, but when I went close to the lava it went into 1st person. It wasn't really a very interesting story of a dream just something strange."
The world was ending and by boyfriend stayed behind to get homework done
I have a dream where everyone in my family were all possessed trying to kill me. I was in my home and recognized everyone face and voice. I was in first person experiencing the whole thing. And I was self aware the whole time.
"I was at a pool party at my grandparents house. And all of my high school friends were there. We were swimming by the pool but the pool was like really deep and you couldn't see the bottom. So some people were deep diving down to the bottom. Then for some reason I went inside but when I walked inside it turned into my cabin but my room was in the basement, which in reality my room is on the first floor. So I go down to my bedroom and I felt really weird. In the room there was another version of me. We started talking, I don't remember what we were talking about but I remember become fustrated with myself. Then at the end i grabbed a small mirror and broke it. And thats all I remember."
"Last night, November 10th, I dreamt a 1st person perspective about my family of 4 living in a single-bedroom house. We moved to a city, resulting in us having to choose a house we could afford. In our living room, we had 1 bunk bed, my brother got the top and I got the bottom. My parents shared a queen-sized bed that was put right next to the bunk. I remember going over to our aunt's house, which was in the suburbs but had a lavish mansion compared to our living space. She lived in a suburb over to the city that we were staying in, and she told us that her house was in the same price range as our one-bedroom house. I remember feeling guilty about not being grateful for living in such a tiny house, but I felt depressed living in such confined spaces. I envied my cousin when she was showing me her own bedroom, and I wondered why we didn't just move to the suburbs instead of living in our tiny house. The entirety of the dream, my living situation was very dark and gloomy, but when I visited the mansion it made my dream a lot more colorful."
"It was about a boy who I recently have been in a weird place with. We were lying in his bed, the sheets were gray, and he was telling me how much he cared for me. In the dream I felt love, cared for, and appreciated."
I was inside a house there was barely any light. I was walking from different rooms and whenever I reached the living room I was told there was a doll following us. It would appear randomly and was affecting the people near me but didn't do anything to me. I know it bothered the rest of the people in my dream but I woke up before anything ever happened to me. I wasn't scared or anything but it was an odd dream.
Was playing golf with my brothers and we were having a lot of laughs and playing well.
I was falling from an airplane with my roommate and when I got close to the ground I woke up sweating.
"My dream was of myself in 10 years, and it started off as a typical day of work. I woke up in the morning and got myself ready for work, which was at a local PT clinic. I remember smelling eggs being cooked and a nice breakfast being made by my wife. After getting ready I came into the living room and sat down at the barstools that were along the center island in the kitchen. After I finished breakfast with my wife, I made my favorite coffee, which is an iced white mocha with caramel drizzle, which always starts my day off right. After giving my wife a kiss, I hop in my truck, which still has its nostalgic feel as its the same truck I have had since high school. Its plushy leather seats and smooth ride bring back good memories, making it difficult to ever get rid of it. Once I arrive at the clinic, I check in with my coworkers and gridn out some morning paperwork and patient files. After that, we open up our doors and thats when I woke up."
"A few nights ago I had a dream about my life in 10 years. It started off with me waking up to the smell of fresh coffee and breakfast being made by my wife. After getting ready for work, I sat down and remembered feeling the warmth of the sun as it came through the dining room windows. As I sat on the barstools at the island countertop, my wife and I discussed the day ahead of us and shared quality time. Soon after that, I got in my truck, which is the same truck that I have had since high school. Its plushy leather seats and smooth ride brought back some amazing memories as I drove to work. When I arrived at my PT clinic, I met with all of my staff and fellow co-workers and got prepared for the first clients. Not long after that we opended up, and I then woke up."
"A guy from my psychology class messaged me wanting to secretly hook up knowing both of us have significant others. I remember feeling confused at first, but thinking about it, and then messaging back to him with a flirty tone. I think I agreed to his offer over message and tried to hide it from my boyfriend. Next thing i remember in the dream is my boyfriend on my phone finding the messages. My heart was pounding in my dream and I even woke up from my heart pounding so hard in real life."
"I was a child in a Desert summer camp surrounded by huge sandstone cliffs with a lake nearby the camp and shipping containers in the middle.

I was walking with my friend a small ginger kid that's a little chubby just chatting and then his dad who is a bald taller ginger guy who is also a wizard shows up and he started to teach us magic, that's when I learned I was pretty good at fire magic and my friend was good at shapeshifting magic and I remember being really jealous of them.

As night time rolls around we would start to play hide and seek and we did that for a bit until it became Halloween and monsters started showing up at night at that point, so my friend try's to shapeshift into a monster that showed up but was found out immediately and the monsters attacked him. So I'm dodging and weaving past all these monsters to get back to the camp and I am terrified so I eventually make it to the center of the camp where there's this giant conference room table with my friends dad there and I was just really confused.

The dad eventually pulls out a projector and he says he's going to show me how my life actually went down, now I am in this giant diner ordering breakfast and i just remember being really happy cause I'm about to order pancake and a shake.

Then we fast forwarded to me as a teenager taking a trip to China, I'm back with my best friend who's now taller still a little chubby and ginger and another friend who has tall and lanky, we're just bar hopping in China trying to get a little drunk. At some point were riding around on electric scooters until we found a portal in the middle leading somewhere just overall confused, while we're confused about the portal two little kids come up and try to steal our scooters.

We decided to leave and we were a little anger but we were also rushed because all of our classmates went to a bigger bar and we're rushing to get to it. As we arrive we meet a little Asian girl in a traditional Chinese dress and a lantern on a long stick saying she'll guide us to the bar as there were monsters on the path. As we're walking I remember I have fire magic and start burning the monsters to protect everyone.

I break off from the group at some point and go into this side hallway with my friend explains how there is a renowned artist that'll really like, as we approach the artist we get attacked by another monster and I burn it as I am being told that the Artist is the one who makes the monsters and they're just sculptures that I have just been destroying. Feeling incredibly guilty I buy some sculptures from the artist as an apology and then I woke up.
"
"I don't really remember how it felt or the whole dream just like little details of the dream. Saw certain people that Ive been in contact with for the last couple weeks, some of the people Ive known and some of them I just meet recently"
"in my dorm, I saw my hometown friends and heard them talking, I don't remember much after that."
I had a dream that I was in Mexico with my best friend walking around in the streets and she was taken and I never came back. I was in my own body and I was running around the street screaming for her to come back.
"in my recent dream, I was on an alligator tour (like the boat). we took a sharp turn, and the boat tipped, the alligators in the area were strangely larger than normal. the alligators were swarming the area, and the people I was with were all trying to get on our sinking boat flipped upside down. slowly, people were getting taken by an alligator and dragged into a barrel roll, and either they were killed or were torn apart limb from limb. ten, the alligator ( biggest one) came swimming over to me right as I was almost on the flipped boat right as its teeth were gonna clamp on my leg, I jolted awake."
"I had a dream of a major argument with my father while driving after a basketball game, I woke up feeling extreme dread. The emotions in the dream were anger"
"The dream took place in my apartment. Me and my roommate had a pet that was like a big axolotl. the pet was the size of a small dog, and it was also blue and had slimy skin. the pet started running around and I had to pick it up; when I did, however, the pet stung me by morphing a small part of its skin into a needle and injecting me with a painful poison that I could feel both in my hand where I was stung and in my kidneys. I drop the pet in pain, and it splits in two while I go to my dad who appears to treat my wound. He used a suction device on the wound before squeezing the wound to extract the poison, which looked like a pimple being popped and a long strand of the solid poison coming out."
"In my dream, I was in trouble with my mother. She was yelling at me, and I felt anxious and scared. I was hiding in my room on my bed. It felt very real and I thought it was happening to me. I was holding my phone. my mom came into the room and I woke up."
A recent dream I had was about a white male around the age of 20 who climbed to the top of the Dorm across from mine and used a rifle to shoot me throw my dorm window. It was early evening in September. It smelled like blood and gun powder. It caused so much panic in the dorm. He then aimed at other floors as people were taking cover. I remember feeling pain in my abdomen. I was the actor. I did change to observer but I was observing myself and how I acted panicked as the shooting continued. As the dream ended I remember it being the next day and it felt like nothing had happened. My wound was healed but there was a scar.
"My friends and I were fishing off of a very high riverbank. One of h=my highschool peers had managed to capture a seamonster in the water below. At some point we decided to take a raft to a nearby port, but my boyfriend upset the people on the raft so he had to jump overboard and abandoned the raft. There was a a warrant out for him because they were upset, so they were searching for him, and I was frantically trying to find him before they did because they wanted to hurt him. It was all very vivid, and lots of people I knew were there. It was all in color, and I could hear the voices of the people in the dream."
I was in the living room of my apartment with my roommates having a detailed discussion over my chemistry class. I remember feeling stressed and upset that I was unable to understand the concepts. My roommates were trying to help and were loud.
"I was cleaning the kitchen at my house with my current roommates. Soap was everywhere on the floor, almost up to our knees. I bent down to start cleaning under the oven, and my hand lit on fire and spread up my arm. I started rolling on the group, but it didn't stop and spread over my whole body. I ran out to my back porch, jumped onto the grass, and felt the cool night grass cool off my body and stop the fire. I then ran to my neighbor's house, screaming for help, and while I was outside with him, I realized I was dreaming. I began to calm down and wasn't anxious, but I still got in his car to be taken to the hospital as my skin was burned to a crisp, and I was now wrapped in white bandages all over my body, despite not having been at the hospital yet. right after I got in the car, I woke up."
Last night I had a dream where I was in another country. I am not sure where I was but there was a parking lot and a lot of fields and the country I was in was at war and I was a teenager along with two of my friends but they were people I don not know in real life. When my friends and I went out we were kidnapped by people on the other side. The main guy who kidnapped us was very large with a long brown beard. I was every scared and was trying to find ways to help my friends and get out of the situation the whole dream but they kept moving us from place to place o we didn't know where we were or how to escape. Most of the places we were held in were moist and there was always water dripping from the celling. it was from my own point of view most of the time but sometimes it would be almost bird's eye view. I always eilevd I would escape somehow in my dream and in the very end I did but my fiends died.
I dreamed of my grandma's friend needing my teddy bear that she gave me for christmas gift
"waterfall, hearing water drops"
"Last night I had a dream I was at a movie theatre by myself, and my friends left me and I was lying on the floor staring at the wall and an old friend came up to me and told me to get up and go home with her, and when I got up a band started playing music as I was walking out crying."
Making Christmas cookies with my mom in my kitchen at home but it was before we had my new kitchen done yet I was the age I am now. We were rolling the dough
"I had a dream that I was pregnant, and I had sent a picture of the ultrasound to my family group chat. My mom hearted the image, but my dad didn't respond. This led me to feel fear and I was the actor in this dream."
"My most recent dream was the my most recent sleep. It was very vivid, like all of my dreams, and I remember most details vividly in the morning. This dream was about going to a hockey game with this guy named Finn who I am talking to right now. He had his arm around my and I remember walking down a lot of stairs. We got food and went to our seats to watch the game but we were walking around the arena for most of the time. After this, I transitioned to almost another realm and it was with this guy named Tanner who I know from home. I was hanging out with him in his car and then I got dropped off and walked to this guy from home's house named Connor. This was a crazy dream I have never had one involving so many men before haha. Anyways, then I went into Connors house and we slept on the couch, and when I woke up in the morning he looked at my phone and saw that I was talking to Tanner so he texted Tanner and then both of them hated me so I left and walked all the way home. The environment was very calm and it was not sunny or gloomy, king of in the middle. The temperature was also mild, but seemed like fall. There were no animals involved. My point of view throughout the entire dream was actor. The emotions that I had were good and felt nice when I was with Finn in the first part of the dream, but they were bad when I was with Connor and Tanner."
My ex boyfriend and I talked over thanksgiving break and it was very emotional and it was back in my hometown in familiar areas like outside my house and his car
I was laying on my back in my boyfriends bed. It was dark in the room but the tv was on. He was on his side cuddling me. I was very happy and content. I noticed a huge pimple on my chest. I popped and the pus went all over my chest neck and face. It was crawling on it like it was alive. I started screaming and trying to wipe it off. My boyfriend grabbed a towel to try to help me. We got it cleaned up and I cried while he held me. I was extremely scared and felt helpless.
Ran a marathon with one person who I haven't seen since high school and my high school golf coach. During the marathon we stopped and had a sit down meal which made our time go longer. Our time was too long and we had to start over. During the dream I was hot and tired
"I was walking in a library. It was quiet I was trying to get to the basement but every time I took the elevator it was going the wrong direction. It was frustrating but also very exciting as I went to different parts of this eight-story library. Each floor was assigned a different theme and label. One was entirely chess-themed with the floors being checkered and everything taking on a dark mahogany and ivory color. I received a text from a friend who was once a lover. I tell him about my adventure. He responds with one-word responses. He then texts ""Texting you bores me. I rather just play the game"" I text back ""You wouldn't be bored if you Facetimed me"". There is no response. I remember waiting forever for that response. And it never came. I get off the elevator to the basement. There was an event I was there for, but I can't recall it. It's more of a garage with cars all over and random tires. The slightly overweight leader comes to talk to me. He was with a group of people that he sent away. He puts on a movie; the movie made me uncomfortable. Being alone with the mechanic leader made me uncomfortable. My dad walks in. I don't know where he came from. He talks to the leader, and they laugh and chat. He says it's time to go. I don't know where. I don't remember why I was in the library."
"I had a dream that I was at my high school, it wasn’t my actual school visually but it was my school in the dream. I was walking through the hallways with white linoleum square tiles and gray walls, and walking away from the end of the hallway into the real building. I was leaving my favorite teacher’s class and saw my abusive ex boyfriend and he smiled at me. He is about 5’6” and has short brown hair with blue eyes and dimples. I was mostly in my own body (actor). He says hi to me so we both walk to an outside parking lot. I feel very weary and confused about what is happening. The parking lot has an old mustang that’s silver, and no yellow parking spaces, just cracked concrete and a bridge overpass. There’s a steep wall of dirt and some sparse grass from the edge of this parking lot to the overpass. We are standing out there and he sincerely apologizes to me for everything he did. I feel peaceful and relief even though it’s been many years since we’ve had contact. He sees his current girlfriend and waves at her, and she smiles and waves back at the both of us. She is by the main entrance to the school, roughly 100 feet away, framed by a large green field followed by an actual parking lot with cars, and a blue sky and large electric poles far in the distance. The building is tall and silver. She has a short light brown bob and blue eyes, and waves with her left hand. She is wearing a purple and orange striped turtleneck. Me and my ex boyfriend turn back to each other, and communicate that the conversation was nice, and we are both glad we could finally mature enough to have the conversation at all. We politely smile at each other and leave our separate ways (him heading towards his girlfriend at the entrance to the school, me going under the bridge into a grassy area)."
"I had a dream where I was with an ex boyfriend, but he was actually a fox who was trying to hook up with me after I told him no so many times, he was an actual animal and kept peeping into my room after I tried locking the door and kicking him out. I don't remember much else after this."
"My ex boyfriend's family invited me on a boating trip with all of his family except for him. We were on their family's lake boat at the local lake we always used to go boating at. While we were floating about, his mom explained to me how much they missed me and that he should have never let me go. She asked me to reach out to him to see if we could get back together. As I was pondering this question, we passed by the shore and we saw him playing football on the beach with some of his friends. I told his mom to look and see that he is not the same person anymore, and she told me that I was right and told me that I shouldn't take him back after what he did. For reference, I was with this boy for two years and the day after I moved into college I found out that he cheated on me. I was extremely close with his family and the relationship was very serious, so I was absolutely devastated. The dream was extremely emotional for me because I had to relive the pain he put me through while also feeling sad that I can no longer be close with his family. The feeling of the dream was home, but as if home was flipped upside down. It all felt wrong and I had the feeling that getting out of there was the best thing to do. I have dreams about home and the past with my ex boyfriend rather frequently, but it is always painful dreams and I wake up distressed or feeling down."
I had a vivid dream that my now ex boyfriend was cheating on me or committing some act. This feeling consisted of feeling under heat and being stressed out to the point where I could feel physical tears form and I was woken up with this feeling.
I had a dream that i got a MIP with my friends and her parents caught me
In my most reason dream my dad had died. I remember feeling anxious and I woke up in a cold sweat from this incident. My dreams typically all start the same and like this one I feel dizzy and I see circles that get bigger and smaller that end up hurting my head. It is an aches feeling and then I appeared in a hotel. It was my family reunion on my dad’s side from a few years ago and we walked around and said hi to everyone. The people their though weren’t my family expect for my dad . I remember then crying on the ground in a panic arc state because he had died in front of me. After this I cried much more then woke up with tears running down my face confused as to where I was.
"I had a dream where I was back in high school walking down the hallway by my Spanish class. I was by my teacher who is short and old. My friend Zach was by me. It felt just like how it used to every day in high school. It was a weird feeling; it felt so real. It was kind of sad because I enjoyed those days, but it was also cool to be back there again."
"I had a dream where I was in my room at my sorority house with my 4 roomates and then we decided to walk to sylas and maddy's on mass street. We sort of teleported there so I don't remember the walk at all but being in the room with my roomate's was a nice pleasant feeling, it felt warm so it must've been a warm day"
"I had a dream that my grade for Organic Chemistry 1 Exam 3 had been graded and I got an 88%. I was surprised, relieved, and happy."
My friend got kidnapped
This happened last week so the lead up to this situation in the dream isn't super clear. I was stuck in a room that wasn't really a room that was slightly red. I was with one of my best friends Annabel and some other random men. There were scorpions attached to me like leeches and I couldn't get them off. The harder I tried to un stick them the deeper they attached and the louder I screamed. Because some of the scorpions were sometimes detaching and falling off around me Annabel and the random men would'nt get near to me (understandably). Freaked me out a lot. I was super freaked out and I woke up from it still able to feel the scorpions.
"I had a dream in the first person that felt like it lasted multiple days where my close friend Alex and I mysteriously died, we thought in a car accident. We couldn’t remember how we died. For a long time we didn’t know we were dead so we were just wandering spirits, we tried going to class before one of our professors pulled us aside and was like you’re dead stop trying to interact with the world, you can’t because you’re dead. She also explained the rules of the universe- when you die, you don’t remember your death so it’s less traumatizing to your soul. Then we left and wandered more. We could kind of communicate with certain people (I had to explain to my little sister I was dead which really messed me up). The whole landscape was very cloudy and hazy, there was a lot of rain. We went on a drive in the rain and drove far away. Also I was lucid for like half the dream, because I was lucid I could do anything I wanted, except I couldn’t stop being dead no matter how hard I tried. It made me think about my mortality when I woke up and was highly disturbed."
"I was with a group of people of varying ages. I didn't know most of the people but I did recognize a friend that I hadn't seen in a very long time. I was very happy to see her. We were making crafts with tubes, plastic string, and other objects in order to make a mini-version of a church. We were at a table, it looked like we were in a house that I had been in at some point before but I did not recognize it. At some point, we all had to get ready for church and then leave. Which is weird because I don't normally go to church and then friend I was doesn't go to the same church I do. There was this little boy that was very defiant and didn't want to get ready for church. He was very dirty and still playing with the crafts so I picked him up and took him to the bathroom and put him in the bath so that I could get him cleaned up. For some reason his head kept going under the water and no matter how many times I tried to pick him up, he would flip and go back under water. I was trying to get him clean and was worried that he was going to drown and no matter how low the water level was, it felt like he was smaller than the water level and I could not get him out. I got him out and I had to get us dressed and I remember putting on mascara with one hand which made my lashes really long, and holding him in my other hand. We made it to church and everyone was looking at us because we were late. We explained to the priest why we were late but it didn't matter and we were kicked out of the service while everyone glared at us. Then I woke up. For the most part everyone looked normal. It was in my point of view as the actor. The ending made me panic and become very nervous and that's why I woke up."
Me and my ex got back together and i got bored of our relationship again but when we were apart I was extremely depressed and missed him so much.
"My dad told me that he would come to Dads weekend, and I planned everything for him to come. I called him on the phone from my dorm room telling him how excited I am for him to come. I was telling him all the fun things I was going to do with him. He was sitting on the couch downstairs on the phone with me. Fast forward to the day of dads weekend, my father called from the house, after he should have left 3 hours before. He told me that he would rather not come cause he didn't want to. I was very upset because my dad didn't care about me. I woke up in the middle of the night crying. 

This sort of happened in real life, however, my dad told me a few days before the event."
Me and my friends found a very large stone by a creek and then we went whitewater rafting on the stone. It made me feel happy and excited. It was in first person riding on the stone going down the creek.
I was with an old friend from school and we were going on a road trip to Arkansas and our car broke down. I remember feeling frustrated and annoyed.
A highschool party with my highschool friends. It felt fun and I enjoyed the dream.
I was in my room and I sceamed at my friend to be quiet.He then almost killed me by grabbing a knife and I woke up.
"I was the starting cornerback for KU Football. When it was game time, whenever I seemed to be in for a play, I would mess up or let someone down. This occurred at the brand-new stadium being built on KU's campus. I felt very disappointed in myself when I couldn't achieve my main goal of having a good game."
I was on vacation with my family in Hawaii and we traveled around Hawaii hiking all the volcanoes. I felt a sense of freedom and relieve being in Hawaii around my family and around all the amazing views. I was the actor because I was living my life and living how I would want.
I was going to school and my sister that lives out of town was going to all my classes and was following me everywhere. There were not as many people on campus and it smelled like Christmas. My professor ending up knowing my sister and then I woke up.
"There is an indoor pool with part of the pool outdoors, and part of the pool indoor. There is a black almost carwash type heavy plastic to keep the cold air outside. I am walking on the pool deck, which also has beach chairs and people sitting in them/ people swimming in the pool. I am there for a swim lesson. I go in for my swim lesson but then have immense fear because there is a great white shark swimming in from the outdoor part of the pool. I now remember that the rest of the pool is connected to the ocean. I swim ( feeling fearful and anxiety and death) and grab the hand rail and get out, but the girl behind me gets her leg bit off and I wake up."
This dream was lucid but I couldn't control what I was seeing only really where I was going. My dream was me being chased by a man in a black cloak through a neighborhood. He had a knife but I never saw it I just knew he had one. It was a bright sunny day but the weather was just eery. While being chased through this neighborhood all the houses looked normal and clean much like a normal white suburban neighborhood. The man in the cloak was chasing me but he never got too close. He mostly followed me through houses and down streets. But the most vivid moment of the dream was when I ran past a house I looked into the only open garage I saw and there was just a body hanging from garage opener. He was white wearing a dark blue flannel and khaki workwear pants. This moment felt frozen in time. The feeling of existential dread fell over me and i woke up from my sleep almost paralyzed in fear.
"I remember sitting in a conference room with two people. One of the people I had a very serious history with, and it led to a confrontation where he pinned me against the wall. He said He was going to try and hurt me while asking the other person for help. The other person refused, and I eventually broke free and stood facing him. We didn't exchange words, but it felt like there was a lot of tension in the room. Then in an instant, there were three different people in the room and all I can remember was them saying they didn't want to be friends anymore. Then I moved to a sidewalk where all I did was walk. It felt like I was reflecting on my past mistakes, and the sidewalk was my punishment."
"I was with my girlfriend in my car, and there was this dude who was trying to get into the car. I thought he was a threat, but there was actually this other dude chasing him and he was trying to escape. He eventually got into the car, but then I woke up and I don't really remember."
I was on canvas and I saw my grade in my online class was a 53% and I felt shock then I woke up.
"I dreamed I had just learned I would be going on a trip to Japan with my cousin. I was elated, packing my bags and chatting with my cousin about our plans, only to be woken up by my alarm clock reminding me that rather than going to Japan, I'd be attending my 9 A.M. lecture in Wescoe Hall instead. Within the dream, though, I heard my cousin's voice, but I did not see his face. However, he was responding to my words just like he would had this been in real life. My point of view was primarily focused on my suitcase because I was packing, and I don't remember any specific smell or taste. My suitcase resembled the one I had at home with a blue shell and blue handles. My POV never really changed, as I was focused on packing and chatting with my cousin. The emotions were light in the dream, and my dream self seemed to be very amused and excited to be going on a 'trip'. Lastly, my cousin was quite excited as well, and I remember him mentioning specific places in Japan that we could visit, such as Himeji Castle and the Itsukushima Jinja."
"The dream started off in a school environment in a locker room directly connected to the library with large windows to the outdoors. The outdoors looked like grassy hills and it was extremely cloudy outside looking like an apocalypse. Only girls where in the locker room library area, but none of them were of my focus. I walked from the locker room to the library to stare out at the windows. Everyone was nervous as there was a zombie apocalypse and I felt as if I was waiting for the inevitable. I looked out the window with a teacher standing next to me and felt terrified because even someone who is older then me can not help the situation. As we are looking out the window we see a single zombie who looks like Michael Myers, but slightly more horrific. As this zombie gets closer he punches through the glass we are looking at and my perspective is closer to the window to where I am actually. Everyone runs for cover, and I run past a broken window of the school with the apocalyptic, green, and gloomy environment. As I am running the school environment changes into a giant fancy house with many rooms that look like people are living in it. The girls still run frantically to get away from the zombie, but I am focused on finding the best hiding spot to not get killed. I run through many connecting bedrooms and other typical rooms you would see in a large house and as I run room to room I see multiple carpeted stairways in this giant house with many windows looking outside and I go to the top of one of these stairways. I had a remembrance of this house in past dreams so I feel as if I know the best place to go. This place was halfway up one of the stairways and had an entrance that was like a small metal door. Where I was hiding was in this metal door, which looks like there is mean't to be electrical things inside. I was peaking out the thin slots of the metal door inside this almost secret room half way up this stairway and last I remember is seeing a girl or two run by and then I saw the zombie."
"During my dream, I was with my now ex-friend and we were conversing in a classroom on why we are no longer friends. During the beginning of the dream I was upset with how she broke our friendship but we spoke about it and later reconciled. I was happy that we were able to be friends again and come together. Later we went out to a bowling ally and we were just happy to be together."
"Friends from highshcool visited and one of them was a guy I used to talk to, but then he got a girlfriend for a long time. He visited and we hungout then the next night I had a dream we were back in school and I was watching him get confronted by her on what he did that weekend. In the dream they had broken up, but it was recent. I was sitting in my old assigned seat in the english class we all used to have together."
"I dreamt that my two friends, Jackie and Kennedy, and I went to a house party in a house on the lake. It was winter time so the water was almost frozen, but we went outside to the dock, and all of a sudden we all had ropes tied to our feet with weights on them. Kennedy and I were on the steps reaching for the water, and we looked behind us and Jackie had fallen into the water. Kennedy and I were freaking out because there were weights on all of our feet but we eventually saved Jackie. We went back inside and ate the snacks from the party."
"The dream I had occurred twice so I went through it one time and in the second one I realized it was a dream since I had gone through it before but it changed instead of me going through the dream I switched to another person since I wasn’t supposed to know what would happen so they killed me. My dream starts in a swimming pool where I’m relaxing and hanging out with my friends. I decide I’m tired of swimming so I go back to my hotel room this is when I realize I had the same dream a couple of night ago. I realize that there is going to be a fire in the hotel I’m staying in and they will not tell anyone in the building. So I rush to get my friends and tell them they have to believe me and to trust me. Although they were ensure they followed me back as to the hotel room to collect our stuff. As we are preparing to leave out the window since doors were locked for some reason a lady knock on the door. I answer and say “you should get out of here there’s going to be a fire”, she looks at me and says you’re not supposed to know that and get this green sprite looking bottle that she throws at me that has flies and acid (this is what killed me). After that I was in one of my friends body and continued on going out the window and into the outdoor pool. I don’t know what we were running from but we we’re running, we finally managed to get to a family members house where we felt safe. We were catching up with each other when all of a sudden there was a fire at the house we were at this is when as a group we realized something is trying to harm us. At the house three of my family members were there my dad, sister, and brother when the fire started we got separated me and my brother were unable to get in the car that my dad and sister got into but we promised to meet at a location. Once me and my brother finally got there my family started talking trying to make sense of what was happening why fire was starting and what was chasing us. However we didn’t have much time as the fire had returned but as meteors we hopped in the car my dad and sister being in the front and me and my brother in the back. We were driving to avoid the meteors but so were other someone crashed into our car and my dad was trying to stay in control but he ends up hitting a pole that goes flying and ends up back into the car killing my dad and sister. Me and my brother were in the back at a loss for words for what had just happened seeing our family dead in front of us. But we realized we had no time to stop to think about them we had to survive so we got out of the car and that is when I woke up from my dream."
"The dream started with me watching the news and there was report that a large meteor was coming to destroy the U.S and the U.S alone. The only way out of the U.S was a large plane that could only carry a certain amount of people. My family and extended family were lucky enough to get tickets and the dream went to the plane. Then the next thing I remembered I was on the plane, and I was talking with my little brother, but from the corner of my eye I could see the pilots putting on oxygen masks, and then the oxygen went out and my dream went dark. I woke up and was extremely out of breath and was tense and almost upright."
"I was at a school event with my best friend. Suddenly, we were being hunted down by some group and had to escape. I remember the environment being warm, like late spring. I heard lots of voices, as everyone was scrambling to run away. I remember it being exciting though, I wasn't scared. It felt like an adventure."
when I start to get lost in a mazed and cry.
"I remember that in the dream I was getting ready for the day. My morning routine consists of texting my boyfriend good morning, washing my face, getting dressed, and doing my makeup. I had dreamt that I had done all of those things, and when I actually woke up for the day, I had already texted my boyfriend, I had already gotten dressed for the day, and I had makeup on and I was basically ready for the day."
I was the kid in home alone and it was electric
"I had a dream about an ex friendship and I was an actor. I was visiting their college, and it was like we were friends again, and my now best friend was worried about me. It made me and my ex-best friend could be friends again. We went to a college party together like we were best friends again. It made me feel weird and just not in the right head space in the next day."
I have had nightmares about people who have left my life.
I got my dream porsche and was able to drive it on a track. there was no cloud in the sky and I was on a private track driving. I dont recall a smell or taste but I did hear the roaring sound of the engline.
my most recent dream I had was when i looked in a mirror and the top of my head of balding and just get growing more and more. All of my friends were in it but I had also just watched santa clause 3 and those characters were in the dream as well. I am not sure where it was located but it was dark.

"I was walking on the top of a tall, rocky mountain that had snow all over it. The mountain was on a beach and you could see the entire ocean off to my right. I was looking down the coastline. As I was walking I started to slip down the side of the mountain, which turned into a very fast scuttle down the side of the mountain. Suddenly I was barefoot and it felt like the whole side of the mountain was made of gravel. I fell faster and faster until I landed on what seemed to be a wooden platform or roof and it cracked and splintered as I fell on top of it. From the cracks, a bunch of little spiders came out and crawled over my feet only to disappear a few seconds later. I continued sliding down the mountain until I landed on the beach thousands of feet below where I saw my mom and the rest of my family waiting for me. At no point during the fall was I scared or feel any impact."
I was playing basketball with my childhood friends and nba stars
"I was walking out of Walmart with my girlfriend, I had flowers, they were white roses because those are her favorite, in my hand as it was our anniversary. I remember it was a sunny and warm outside and I suggested we go to a park for a picnic and once we got in my car I woke up. The dream was definitely a pov from my perspective as it was incredibly real. I don't remember anything about the people except for my girlfriend, I don't remember seeing her face except just holding her hand as we walked. I was very happy because it was our anniversary but felt sad when I woke up."
My most recent dream was about getting myself into a stressful situation with my friends; it made me feel tense and tired after I woke up.

"I got on one of the KU buses and sat next to the guy I like. He was reading a book on his kindle. He then turned to me and told me I didn't look like I read books. He did this in a way that made it seem he was superior to me, which I did not like. I then told him I did and then he became super nice and we talked for a little bit (I can't remember about what). All of a sudden we were in my Prius driving down the highway and my little brother was in the backseat an d the guy I liked was in the passenger seat. No one was talking and it was on a highway that I recognized but wasn't sure where it was. We then all of a sudden arrived at the house of my brothers best friend and were treated by his ex and some random dude. Apparently in the dream the guy I liked lived close to my brothers best friend's house so he knew them. We then went inside and the mom of my brother's best friend began trying to give us hats and gloves. This whole dream I was feeling very happy and exited."
"I was going to this alien planet planet and commanding an army of humans to fight against this bad alien force and I had a family, a wife and two sons. It was very colorful with aquatic colors and I remember that I was floating/flying."
I had a dream that I was balding and very ugly. And all the people around me were making fun of me. The cast of Santa Clause 3 was also in my dream. I woke up from my dream because I was so upset and scared. My friends were also in my dream not helping me.
"It was a first person dream. i’ve had this dream 3 times. The first time was 3 years ago. The second was 2. This one was a week ago. I was in a big indoor water park with a bunch of people i knew and my girlfriend. i could tell we were on a trip of some kind and there was a tour guide sort of leading us around the facility.  He took us past a big really fast lazy river and water slides. Then we went downstairs and he took us through a door where there was a large open area that was meant to look like a water fall. and they had a deck wrapping around the waterfall. I remember feeling in awe and i wanted to jump off of a walk the plank sort of plank into the water, but they wouldn’t let me. then i remember leaving and going into the really fast lazy river and jumping in with a tube. It was going so fast tho that i was slamming against all the walls and getting pulled under the water and so i flipped myself over and tried riding it out but i kept hitting against the walls. I remembered that i was dreaming in my dream and so i made the waters slow down and i got out and we all left and i woke up."
"The most recent dream I remember was I was at the Jayhawk cafe with my friends from Arizona and we all were having a really fun time. Then my friend maya comes up to me and is holding a baby, but when I get closer to it I realize that the baby is like 1 inch big it is tiny and looks like a fetus.Then my Maya starts shaking it and eventually drops it on the ground and it dies. I remember being so scared and yelling at her to drop it because I knew the baby was so small and that it could get hurt."
I was back in highschool english class and this couple had just broken up and the guy was getting confronted about what he had been doing that weekend. I was stressed becasue in real lifeI the guy had visited KU the weekend before.
"I was visting my brother in a nursing home and he had demantia and didnt reconize me for some reason, I felt upset about it and thought about it for the rest of the day"
"It felt fantastical. It was me and the girl I had a crush on, Jasmine. We walked on a huge tree high in the sky. The weather was chilly and we both had black hoodies walking close to each other feeling each others warmth. It felt like a cold winter or fall day with a warmth aura like sitting by a window during christmas. I heard the rustling of the leaves as the wind hit the tree. I could smell the freshness of the air and the trees. It was all from my point of view. Me and Jasmine walked on and up the tree embracing one another. The dream was euphoric and I can only dream to have an experience like that in real life. It gave me a sense of security and joy."
"This dream starts with me and my brother coming back from lunch at school and we are late to class so we get snacks from the store inside the school and we are getting donuts, muffins crescents, candy and other random things. I felt bad because my brother was paying so I put some of the things I grabbed back. The total was $27.49. Once he paid,  we head to class. We go into a computer lab/library room. My brother's girlfriend is with us and she sits in a pink rectangle chair and my brother sits at the other end forcing me to sit in the middle between them. I ask my brother if he wants to switch and he says no because it would be too tight for him and his foot always gets stuck when he sits there. I squeeze in and we start eating out snacks. Then, a kid across from us pulls out a gun and points it at someone near us. I immediately duck and start heading towards the door. I get to the hall and start running towards the nearest exit, but someone is running from that direction and tells me it is guarded. I run the other direction down some stairs, but didn't go down the steps I just jumped because there were only five stairs. The halls were surprisingly empty, only a few people here and there. From the direction I was running from, someone yells there is a bomb. I pick up the pace and see another exit. I run to it and out the doors, but the shooters didn't like that I was escaping. They were shooting at me as I was running from the building and I heard the shots missing around me. There is a car repair shop across the street, so I go there. I hide behind a truck and one of the power line towers falls down. The workers move it out of my way and I explain to them what is happening. I don't know how, but I am back inside the school. This time, the halls are crowded with people and my mind if flooded with screams. This time I'm not trying to find a way out, I'm trying to find someone, but I don't know who. I'm looking all around and avoiding the direction of screams and gunshots. A huge crowd of people start running towards me. I turn and there are more people coming from a perpendicular hall. I turn down a small hallway and water starts rushing towards me. I turn back, and the hall I was just in is completely flooded almost reaching the ceiling. People are floating on top. Me getting washed away in inevitable. I take a deep breathe and jump in. I swim to the top and there are lots of people crammed together. A kid from theatre that I recognize is laughing as he pulls out a gun and aims it at someone. I yell, ""No!"" and he looks at me and says, ""Oh, do you want to give it a shot?"" and laughs even harder at his joke. I take the gun and throw it in the water. He gets very upset, but I grab his head trying to calm and distract him. The water, and people, eventually come crashing out of the school door. There is a wedding photo shoot going on and all the little girls are wearing white poofy dresses, now soaked due to the flood. On the other side of the fence is another photo shoot. The girls are wearing blue poofy dresses and the bride wears a tight white gown. Her hair is up in an elegant bun on the back of her head. She is slender and tall with kind eyes. I go over to her and ask for help. I explain to her what is going on and she hugs me, getting her all wet, but she doesn't mind. I ask if I can call my mom and she hands me her phone. I type her number but on digit is wrong each time and it won't type in correctly. I start to cry out of stress and ask her to help me type it in, but she takes the phone and searches for the nearest hospital to take me to. I refuse because I feel fine, I just want my mom. At this point, I am sitting on the side of a busy road, soaking wet crying in one of the white poofy dresses. The bride wraps a towel around me and tells me I am one of the many survivors of the school shooting, but I can't help to think that I survived twice. I start having flashbacks. Except this time I can see from the shooter's perspective. Apparently, only two people inside had guns and the people on the outside guarding the doors were making gun sounds with fireworks to trick people. I see myself running out the doors from when I escaped the first time, but no one was shooting at me. Just fireworks going off. I started crying and then i woke up. 

A different dream. 
I can't remember how the dream actually begins, but I remember that everyone was paranoid because that day, the world was either going to end, or we were going to continue on with out lives like normal. People didn't know what to do or how to react because they were unsure if they should go crazy and live out their last day or be cautious because things might carry on. Well, come to find out, the sun was getting to earth and it would scorch the eartch at midngiht that same night. The whole earth would become aflame and all life would end. I was in my room and I looked out the window and saw the sun and it looked really wicked. It had a swirl in the middle and all the rays were dark orange, yellow, and red vines all wound together on 3-D cones. My mom was the one who told me the news that was happening, so I decided to take a shower, but a quick one so I wasn't wasting much of my last day. Everyone was trying to live the best last day ever, so me, my mom, her boyfriend at the time, and my sister all went out. We were walking along the road and my school's marching band was playing and marching by. I was really surprised that my band director still made them play through the circumstances of the day. Since I never got to go to prom, me and my mom went dress shopping. The ladies working there helped me pick out the dress and it was a two piece set, the top was a light yellow tube top with darker yellow flowers all over. The bottoms were the same color but with a plaid design instead. I tried it on and everything was too big for me, not to mention it didn't even match. We went out of the dressing room to look for dresses ourselves, and my friend was also there trying on a skin tight dress. After dress shopping, I had to go line up with the marching band to perform and march. I was standing behind two girls that were not in marching band as long as me, and I was feeling quite upset. I ran in front of her because I didn't feel like it was fair. After we were done, we were driving home and I felt anxious knowing in a few hours I would be burning to death. Later, my boyfriend came over and we made a cake that was car shaped/themed. My mom was busy replacing every photo in the house with either the sun or a pumpkin. For example, there was a picture of my brother at the beach and he was also conveniently holding a pumpkin pen. Anyway, we were all downstairs (myself, my sister, my mom and my brother), and we were all scared. I was asking questions like, ""Is it going to hurt?"" and my mom bluntly answered yes and I was shocked at the fact she wasn't trying to comfort me. She told me if I went to sleep, maybe it won't hurt as much. I appeared at my dad's house and one of my friends were there and I hugged her because she was crying. All my siblings were there. One of my exes walks in and my little brother asks him for a banana and he tries to give him one from the trash can. I left and I was in a van with all these random people and they kept challenging me to get out of the van while it was driving and do random things so I would. One time they started driving too fast before I was back inside and I was just holding onto the handle flinging around and we were all singing the Disney song we don't talk about bruno and then I pulled myself back inside and told everyone what happened and they just laughed. I went back to my dads and all my younger siblings were just on their phones and ipads because my dad didn't tell them what was happening. I was just standing there waiting for it to get hot, but it wasn't and I woke up. 


"
I was at an art gallery and nothing much happened I just saw people walking around
I did not see much but I saw a car that I really liked but it was dark and it couldn't really been seen.
"The first dream that comes to mind was I was stranded in the middle of the Lake of The Ozarks. However, it was an ocean and killer whales where beneath me. There were tons of kayaks and smaller boats near by I swam to in fear. The water was cold but nice and I knew my mom was looking for me. I was scared and I flipped the nearest Kayaker while tryin to gran on. I found a boat with a girl I knew on it, and I was able to be safe however her family was mad that I had gotten onto the boat with them. We sailed over the whales- I have reoccurring dreams of whales. I was out of breath, still worried but relieved. I saw my mom on the lake houses shore line and she waved me over."
I felt like I was the main character of a drama that didnt end well. I had this glooming feeling over me the entire time.
I was in the hospital and i felt scared and I was able to hear and see things but the doctors and other people didn't think I could
My last dream was a while ago and it was pretty rememberable after i woke up but from what I remember i was with these random girls and a couple basketball players in the city bar hopping until 5 in the morning . We didn’t get home until around 6 and woke and still went to class the same morning.
"I had a dream that when I got back from thanksgiving break my room had expanded by double and 2 other girls moved in. I remember that our beds and desks were all squished into the middle of our room. I was really confused and angry because they ruined our whole room and I hated the posters they put up. They were all of cabbage patch dolls. Me and my roomate told them that we had to change how the room was set up. They were really rude. They also said that they just transferred to ku from the community college in my hometown of Fort Collins, CO. No one told us they were moving in and I woke up in a panic thinking it was true."
"In the dream I had most recently I was the observer watching the scene unfold, however, I was also an actor. It felt as though my body was the observer, but my person as a whole was an actor. In my dream I was with my roommate and one of my best friends here. We were at Kohl's shopping for a present for my best friend's mom. She wanted a gift that would remind her mom of their dog who had just passed. That is true in the real world- My best friend was looking for a present for her mom in this sense, just not all of us at kohl's. In Kohl's I found a lego picture frame, and told her that this would be a good gift, but she took offense to it and got very upset. So we went back to our dorm (however, in the dream it was a penthouse). Then I had to go to my grandparents and they were supposed to come with me, but instead they left. When I got to my grandparents no one else was there, until a fairy godmother type of figure came out. Prior to that, I had texted my roommate to have her tell my best friend that I was very sorry. The fairy godmother type of figure gave me a gift to give to my best friend, but then I woke up."
i was hurt and got shot and felt a pain
car wreck
I was with some people i know and we were running away from people who were trying to kill us.
Last night I had a dream that my boss was at my house for a reason that I cannot remember. I was acting as myself in this dream. We were inside of my bathroom in my house looking at this fish tank-like thing that had this teensy tiny lantern fish inside of it. I got excited because I love tiny things. I wanted to look at it better with a UV light (i thought it might be fluorescent) so I took my UV light from my cabinet that I use to cure my gel nails and I held it up to the glass and I couldn't find the fish. I felt disappointed because I feel like everytime I get excited about something it disappears. My boss was looking over my shoulder trying to find the fish with me. We rotated the small tank and we saw the lantern fish swimming around with other fish. I then woke up to my alarm.
I had a dream I saw my friend from here at my house in Utah
"In my dream i was a student, it started off with like a sort of recap of another dream i had the other dream was mainly me going to my college/school and finding my classes in this dream i was back in that same school just walking around going to class with friends and my sister. Once we were done we went back home and somehow it was the next day we went back to school but couldn’t find any parking so we just parked in the middle of the street and jumped over a fence to get into school. Once we were over the fence the dream shifted to us inside a school building trying to find a class when all of a sudden my sister goes inside a class and i couldn’t find her i felt my heart sink and start pounding but then i found her in a different class that was empty but she somehow swapped with a one of my cousins and she was pointing at this African American lady that she was so excited to see I didn’t know who it was but the lady said that she was a little kid my mom had saved from something bad and she was excited to see us a whole class of students then appeared in the room and I could recognize some faces from my high school she then proceeded to teach the class because she was a guest speaker. My friend then told us to leave because we were going to be late so we left and my dream somehow shifted to us being outside by our car and on the way home I realized i had 3 other classes i needed to go to so i went back and ran across the fence but I noticed other kids were running away from the building so i rant towards the crowd and many people were telling me to follow the crowd and i met up with the lady again we both saw that there were shooters hunting students down so we began to run towards my car but we got trapped by a wall and the shooter was going to shoot me but the lady got in front of me and took the shot for me as she laid here she told me it was a repayment for what my mom did all those years ago. The dream was weird it went form seeing everything in my eyes to me just spectating the dream while still feeling everything. I then ran out of the place and got into my car and drove away on the way home a semi hit me as i was taking a turn and completely ruined my car i was then taken to the hospital and i was lying in bed on the verge of dying and i was seconds away form dying but then the dream was over."
My most recent dream I had I was in school and was taking a test and failed my test
"I was taking a test and failed, Everything is grey and blurry, It's in first person view."
I had a dream that my room was being checked by the RAs and they were looking for something and me and all my friends were watching them.
"I was in my own perspective, in my body. I was at my horse barn in colorado. It is snowy and cold so I am in the indoor arena. There are two small jumps set up on two diagonals on the ring. One of the jumps have red and white poles in a stripped pattern and the other jump has purple and yellow poles with the same stripped pattern. The purple/yellow jump is on the right side and the red/white jump is on the left. I am at the south side of the ring, which is the shorter side of the rectangular ring. I am standing in the middle of the short side. My trainer is to my right. She has grayish, brownish, blondish hair (she gets it dyed). She is in a big white jacket with the barn logo on the back on it. She has on a light gray athletic think headband, that is covering her ears. She is an older woman. She has on dark gray cargo pants, with lots of pockets. She is sitting in the corner on a tall chair, with three of the same tall, wooden chairs to her left. To my right there is a set of metal bleechers. 
I am watching a young, middle school or early high school aged girl, with a burgandy colored, thin sweatshirt and tan pants on, ride my horse. My horse is a big 17.3 hand light brown horse. The girl is going over the red/white jump coming toward me. 
I am watching her ride because she is trying more horse for a lease. I feel conflicted. I want her to like him and lease him so that he can stay at this barn with me, but I am also sad that I won't be the one riding him and that someone else will get to ride him. 
There are three other horses/riders in the arena. They are all walking counter-clockwise. All of the other three riders are high school aged."
That my sister got kidnapped in the middle of the night. I remember sweating and waking up scared.
I was at wrigley field playing catch with my dog in the snow
"i was in my dorm and my roommate was in the bathroom in the shower. i was standing at the sink outside the bathroom and near the door. i received a call from my younger brother, except my dad picked it up and told me to return home to st. louis as soon as possible because my mom was in the hospital and the doctors did not know if she would make it. I am in college in lawrence, kansas without a car, so i was panicking and crying as i did not know how i would make it home. I was staring at the bathroom door debating whether or not i should barge in and tell my roommate. I decided against it and rushed out the dorm quickly and made my way outside in the cold, winter air. I was crying hysterically as i thought about losing my mom. A guy i know who is a tall brown skin freshman with short curly hair who I know is from st. louis happen to be outside too. i ran over to him with my arms crossed, trying to keep in my warmth. I asked him if he had his car and he said yes. I asked if he could take me back home because my mom was in the hospital and i offered to pay for gas. he was very glad and willing to drive me back and we immediately went to his car and drove four hours to St. Louis. I cried majority of the ride as he held my hand to comfort me. We walked into the hospital and my dad asked who the guy was and as i was about to answer, my dad said he did not care because he was more worried about my mom. [Cutscene] I am hanging out with the guy and we are dating now and my mom is okay. I am happier than I have ever been."
"I had a dream in which i was building a hut in a forest for refugees, the forest was lush and green. the forest was filled with fern trees and snow, there was a gentle fall of snow and a soft breeze but not so much that it was uncomfortable. I didnt smell anything however i felt a sense of urgency, like it was important that it was build as soon as possible. after a while my viewpoint changed to the pov of my grandpa as a mob boss, and i found out i was making a camp to protect people from him."
"In my 3 story house I was on the 3rd floor in my room and I walk down stairs and see people from the hunger games who lived in the capitol walking into my house and into my basement where there was a capitol hunger games party. There were in crazy costumes like tigris, and evie from the hunger games. The house used to be my grandpas and he came and yelled at everyone to get out of his house. My grandpa in real life was dead at the time."
I was flying around saving crickets from getting ate be humans.
"I was in my old house and I was young. My old house used to scare me when I was little so the setting and color was very grey and kind of green. All of the lights off were in the house but ti was daylight outside and I remember hearing weird noises in my dream that caused me too wake up. So i called out for my mom and I couldn't find her so I go into her bedroom and pulled the covers and my step dad and mom were skeletons, so I got scared and hid under the bed. I remember crying in my dream and then I heard my name so I looked to my right and there was like a demon or something staring at me then I woke up."
I went on a vacation with my pledge brothers on some island in maybe the Caribbean.
"I had a dream about these people that I met here in college, so having them in my dream wasn't weird, and it was just a seemingly casual interaction in my dream. I was with these two guys I'm friends with, and one of them was telling me a story. All of a sudden, a couple of weeks later, this exact interaction plays out in real life with these two people. I have had this same instance happen a couple of times since I have been at college."
I was falling off my bed. and I was falling for a long time and I felt my stomach drop.
"I had a dream that I guy I really like was trying to help me when I was in a panic, but I am very upset with this man so I was not allowing him to help me although he kept trying. it made me feel very sad for some reason"
Last night I had a dream I was about to present a huge project to my class. I remember feeling scared and my stomach even hurt in my dream. It was my turn to present and I was sweating standing in front of all of my classmates but I ended up doing it and everything was ok.
I was in a Zombie Apocalypse
I brought my cat from back home to college. She was very scared but once she was with me we both felt at ease. She hated the car ride since it was eight hours. Once I brought her into my dorm she was happy. We both were happy and I wish it was a reality.
