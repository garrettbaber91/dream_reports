re21rk,"I was in uniform for the Army and I remember helping two other females around my age into a helicopter (doors off). I have flown in them several times, but for some reason this one I was stressed. The crew asked me to do one thing for the helicopter and I nodded, but did not which way it should go. I moved it and ""hoped for the best"", which is interesting because I always ask questions, and then we went up in the air. I remember we were stressed about a time crunch, and that I felt I was protecting and leading the two females I brought. There were two pilot and a crew chief, all males and all fairly older. I remember alarms going off and worrying, but then felt a sudden wave of peace. I knew we would be okay, helicopters are meant to roll. I was talking to the girls making sure they were strapped in while staying in my seat. Then the helicopter hit the ground, but it did not roll. That's when I got nervous. We were sliding on the left side, the side I was sitting on. I remembering suddenly the peace went away and this is not what helicopters are meant for. It was so real it was as if I could reach out my hand and touch the ground that was rapidly moving beneath us. We finally stopped and before I helped the girls out, I noticed one was bleeding from underneath her helmet and the other was slightly bleeding on her arm. I tried to speak to the pilots but they were both passed out. I took the girls up the side and we got out. I remember feeling dizzy as if it was hard to walk. I began checking out one of the girls head injury and then someone touched my shoulder and it was one of the pilots, who looked horrible. He said ""you have somewhere to be"" and I thought he was crazy, I wasn't going anywhere. Then he told me to hurry and suddenly I was in one of my best friends wedding as a bridesmaid (that wedding has already happened and I was a bridesmaid). We were all in the same blue dresses as in real life and had flowers in our hands. We were in a line, waiting to walk down the aisle of a white small barn looking building. I remember everything felt extremely bright. I thought did no one see the helicopter crash outside? How did I get here? How did I get into a dress? Then one of the bridesmaids began picking at my hair and saying it was not right, and saying I should have fixed my curls. Then I began to panic again. I was not prepared for the wedding what was I thinking. Then I went to walk down the aisle and saw a bunch of bright lights and then passed out. Some were worried but the bridesmaids were quietly yelling at me that I was ruining the wedding. I sat there wondering why no one was concered there was a helicopter crash. I wandered if the crew was alright. Then I went to stand up and saw stars, and I felt myself passing out. Then I woke up. Sweating.",21,89,94,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,5,2,3,1,1,4,1
ko07go,I honestly dont really have dreams that I can remember. The most that I can remember is if I see a face I recognize and that is typically someone I interacted with earlier on in that day. The locations of my dreams are also typically places I have been recently. Any other specifics I rarely remember though. My two most recent dreams were in my friends house and all I can remember are their faces and the location. And the other was in Rusty Taco and we were sitting in the corner booth. Thats really all I can remember from them though.,80,18,70,2,3,2,4,4,4,4,2,1,1,2,1,2,0
ho06le,The setting was all white except for an old-styled diner booth. the booth was scalloped and sparkly teal with a grey metallic table. I was sitting on one side of the booth from an actor's perspective and my grandpa whom I never met before he died was in the other side. the view never changed in my dream. overall it was him asking me about recent events and how college was going. I was happy to see him and I was upset when I woke up,87,18,56,4,4,4,3,4,4,4,1,1,2,1,1,1,0
PE19TY,"I was the actor, I was in my home after a basketball game that was about an hour away. I was home alone and got a call from an unknown number. When I answered, I was greeted by a Sheriff who informed me that there had been a car accident with 4 people. Two of them had passed away and two were in a critical state and were being held in the ICU. When I asked who they were, he told me that there were two adults and two teenage boys. My family. I dropped to the floor in a panic and started to cry and felt an immense amount of emotional pain. I remember feeling like I was sinking into the floor and everything was dizzy and cloudy. I then drove to the hospital that was 20 minutes away and saw the bodies of my parents and then walked to the ICU and saw my two brothers mutilated and hooked up to wires keeping them alive. I sat distraught in the room that held them both as the nurses and doctors told me about their issues and what I should expect. Everything was a mumbled mess and I was not able to coherently hear what they were saying. They told me that I should sign a release form that would unplug the equipment, ending their lives. I began to scream and curse at them, and it escalated to a physical fight between myself and the nurses trying to calm me down. I was then handcuffed to a chair and sedated. When I woke up, I decided I needed to call someone to help me with the decisions. I called my grandma who lived 5 hours away, and she told me that she was on the way. I then called my brother's girlfriend's mom, who was a close friend of my parents. 

While lucid in the dream, I came up with different scenarios, one of the others being that my older brother was not involved in the accident, and I had to call him and tell him the news. I then had to plan the funeral, sell the house, and pack up all of my family members' belongings, as I was the only one able to. I woke up in a sweat with a pounding heart.

bu10ce,"I dreamt that I was out shopping with my paternal grandmother, my elder sister, and my mother. We left one store and entered another, however, somehow, a wad of cash from the previous store ended up in my grandmothers purse. This was completely on accident as when we discovered the money, my grandmother was distraught and in tears. The shop owner of the current shop we were in believed my grandmother could have stolen the money from the previous shop so he insisted on searching her. While my mother and I were comforting my grandmother, the wad of cash that was taken from my grandmothers purse and left on the counter went missing. I immediately knew it was my elder sister who stole the money and I accused her of so. It became an all out screaming battle as I told my mother I knew my elder sister was using drugs and thats why she stole the money. It was very angry and tense. I then woke up.",0,100,100,1,1,1,1,4,1,1,5,5,5,4,1,1,1
An16tt,"The dream is fragmented, but I was driving a car inside of a building. I was trying to find a way to get it outside because I knew I wasn't supposed to be driving inside. At one point I had to drive it down a short flight of stairs and was concerned that it would damage the bumper. 

The next segment, I was again driving; however, I was traveling south on Hwy 1 in California, I was north of Waddell Creek near Ano Nuevo State Park. It seemed like the dream was on repeat because I would make it past an area of the highway that is set between a steep cliff drop off and a cliff wall that is notorious for landslides. I wasn't concerned about a landslide; rather, I was concerned that the ocean kept rising and the waves were reaching the highway. High tide was coming, and the water was threatening to cover the road entirely. Each time I would make it past the stretch of road, I would turn around and drive it again. It seemed odd that I wasn't scared driving north on the highway, only on the drive south. The last trip south, the tide came up to the road and started to pull the car out to sea. I had someone with me (I'm not sure who, but I think it was my son), and I kept trying to find traction with the wheels. I woke up at that point, but I can remember feeling the wave like motion and I wasn't concerned about myself, but I had utter terror that the person with me was about to die.",0,100,100,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,5,2,1,3,1,1,1
Mi18an,"The last dream I had that I can remember fully is a dream I had about going to a party. I was in a house that was two stories tall and had a balcony on the second floor. I was myself but I also felt younger, like I was a senior in high school again. I had my original brown hair color with a black crop top and jeans. I felt happy and drunk and out of breath from dancing. The music was loud and were basic party songs like Kesha. I was drinking a lot, it tasted like some kind of vodka drink and I was dancing everywhere. I then went upstairs and started making out with my girlfriend in a room with my old friends. We then passed around a joint and smoked. I then laid down on a bed and watched the ceiling spin as I smiled. That was then the end of my dream.",100,2,100,5,5,2,5,1,5,5,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
Cr15le,"This dream was from a few days ago, and it was in an amalgamation of the University of Kansas campus, the play place jungle gyms in McDonald's, and the Five Nights at Freddy's: Security Breach location all scrambled together. There was also some underground tunnels from this reoccurring location in my dreams: an older looking hospital type moment. It was in the first person, and I was myself. My friend Natalie was there and some of the people who live on her floor as well, in addition to a few of my other friends as well. In total, it was me, Natalie, Julia, Lydia, Spencer, and though he was not there, Sebastian was referenced by name. It was mostly dark and cold, and Julia would not stop crying; Sebastian just dumped her. We were running away from something, winding around buildings and alleys before we came across this building everyone thought would be a good place to hide. I was scared because it didn't feel right to me, but everyone ran in, so I followed behind. We stopped a couple times to talk and strategize, but it was all very frantic and not very well planned. Julia was still crying and sad, and I wanted to comfort her very badly and make her feel better. I wanted to hug her and hold her until she could breathe. And then we had to start running again because if we didn't something bad would happen. I didn't know what it was, though. We ran down some stairs and through some rooms that were only lit with emergency-lights. We got to a ground floor, where we ran down the hall to a garage/loading dock area. To the left there was a old rusted ladder that went down a few flights. One by one the group began filing down, as fast as possible. I brought up the rear, and the ladder broke while I was climbing on it. I fell on the ground and was stuck up in the ladder, and everyone ran through the underground sewer-like pipe tunnels and left me behind. I looked up to the loading dock where we just climbed down from and saw the things that were chasing us. they jumped down from where we just were and grabbed me- presumably to kill me- but that part was where I woke up.",0,100,92,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,5,1,5,1,1,5,0
Re17ls,My family and I were staying at a resort in Florida. The rooms were private and had a balcony and outside area that connected to the ocean/swamp by the resort. I woke up from bed and my brothers and I went outside. It was dark and one of my brothers was playing the water. All of a sudden an alligator bit him and dragged him down to the bottom. I screamed and my dad came running outside to save him. Then hundreds of alligators showed up and started swimming to the door. I ran inside and that's when I woke up.,0,70,70,1,1,1,1,4,1,1,4,3,4,1,1,1,0
li08an,"My brother and I were in the car. We were heading somewhere that was time was sensitive. My brother was the driver. We were on the street by Cap Fed and Naismith Hall. He took a wrong turn and made a U-turn. He decided halfway through he didn't want to go anymore, so he took another u-turn. It pissed me off because I knew I was going to be late to wherever we were going. So I looked up and there was a giant clock and it was one of those digital clocks that showed you the number and it had read 6:30 on it. After realizing I was going to be late now, I threw the first punch, then he hit me back. We started fighting in the car and that's when I woke up. I remember waking up extremely pissed. The color of my dream was distorted. The sky wasn't blue and the grass was not green. But the floor was lava. Similar to Mario Kart's lava map. My point of view stayed in first person the entire dream.",0,55,86,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,4,5,3,2,1,2,0
ke24as,"I remember I was in a house trying to find something. I'm not sure I what I was trying to find but the house was a peel apart house. So I was able to ""fly"" but not like easily. Think about it more as swimming. So I was peeling back walls and floors and different areas would apear like a jungle or another room. I peeled open the floor and inside was the ocean. I tried to close it but a shark was coming so I couldn't. Thats the most I remember.",30,73,31,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,4,1,1,1,1,3,0
isa.val,"I was dreaming about how my mom surprised me with a trip to Arizona for 10 days. I was a little upset because this was over break and I wanted to hangout with my friends while I was back in college. When I got to Arizona, my cousins and friends were also there. We randomly went to the beach (I know there's not one in Arizona) and hung out in the ocean for hours. We had a big party that night and celebrated something.",69,0,36,4,4,4,1,5,1,1,1,1,3,1,1,1,0
Za17as,I had a dream that I was in Stars Hallow (a ficitional town in the show Gilmore Girls). It was fall and the leaves were falling as I took a sip of the coffee I had bought from Luke's diner. I was able to meet Lorelai Gilmore and the people of Stars Hallow. It felt surreal to be inside one of my favorite shows. The plot was just a normal day in the fall and I was able to experience the small town lifestyle firsthand. I felt happy and content.,94,1,69,5,5,5,3,4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0

Ma20er,"I was in a cabin celebrating the Fourth of July with my husband and kids, it was nighttime and we were packing up to leave and go back home. It was kind of stressful at first trying to round up the three kids but I had my husband help so it was easier. It was more of a chilly night and there were a lot of mosquitos everywhere. They were all coming from the lake, so I went down before we left to set some traps but then they all flew towards me and started biting me, and then I fell to the ground unconscious. I woke up in the hospital with my whole family surrounding me I felt a burning sensation all over and that's when I got scared and woke up.",30,80,70,4,1,2,4,1,2,1,3,2,1,3,1,1,0
