he11ka,"In this dream I was the actor and I was myself, but the environment changed frequently. I remember distinctly not having clothes on but sometimes having a towel on (not sure where it came from) but I felt embarrassed because a lot of my college and hometown friends were there and could see me naked, but I didn't want to be seen that way. However, they were acting completely normal and like nothing was wrong with me, but I still felt very self conscious. The environment I remember most was being in a rundown part of a city while it was gloomy and raining and everything had a slate grey/green glow. In that part of the dream, I had a towel to cover myself partially with but I don't remember my goal in being there. I only remember looking around in the sewer drains in the street and at the dark buildings, following the crowd of my friends, and trying to keep the towel around me situated so I was covered up. I know I was in other places as well, with a very similar plot, but I do not remember these places well enough to describe them in great detail. I only remember that at least one of them had a lighter environment where it was not raining.",10,90,35,1,3,1,1,3,2,1,3,1,1,1,1,5,0
mo23he,"I was in bed next to my mom and was really anxious because she was dying and she was like doing the typical movie deathbed advice stuff. Then out of nowhere Miranda Bailey (from Grey's Anatomy) got on the bed and like shot her. I didn't see blood or anything and there weren't like bullets, but I understood that Bailey had killed her and then Bailey came for me, but I managed to get the gun from her and shoot her instead (still no blood or gore, just like the concept that she was dead as well).",0,100,60,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,5,4,5,1,1,1,0
bl18le,"I was walking on the sidewalk of a street that resembled Massachusetts Street. It was dark outside and I was carrying my wallet, phone, and computer. I'm not sure where I was going. I was the actor in the dream. Someone came up from behind me and stole my wallet, phone, and computer and ran away before I could see who it was. At the same time a car drove by and it was my roommates/friends car and my roommate was it in. She was an Uber driver which is not true in real life. There were many people in her car and they were talking very loudly with the windows open. Then the person who stole my belongings got in the car, and my roommate drove away but didn't notice I was there. Then it started pouring rain and I somehow got to a high school cafeteria that I've never seen before and I'm not sure how I got there. From the outside the building looked like a large shed. It was really crowded and loud inside and I didn't recognize any of the people. I met my roommate there and told her what happened and she took me to the people that she had given an Uber to. We convinced the people to give me my belongings back and they did. I felt happy and that everything was fixed. Then, I turned on my phone and the entire memory was wiped and I wanted to text my mom what happened but I wasn't able to make texts or phone calls because it wasn't working. Then I started crying in my dream because I was scared, and then I opened my wallet and all of my cards and money were gone. My drivers license was not my real license and the back side of my license was black. However, my computer was fine and the memory was still there. After this my roommate and I went back to where we were living but it's not a place that I recognize from real life. I didn't see the outside but inside it had a very narrow spiral staircase up to two small separate bedrooms. There was a bed in my room and a large, wooden triangle in the corner that I'm not sure what it was for. I didn't know what to do and I felt alone ad like I couldn't get help. Then I woke up to my alarm.",10,100,70,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,4,4,5,1,1,4,0
Ma11an,"I was with my family at my grandparents house in Puerto Rico, in the dream I had a child and I felt that I had to protect him all the time because I loved him more than anything. It was Christmas eve and we were all eating and talking about life and stories. I remember my aunties talking on my back saying that I was too young to have a kid and they never expected me to have one. This dream was very meaningful because I don’t have kids neither I’m pregnant, so I felt like a mom.

ru10os,"I was looking into a kitchen that belongs to a friend I haven't spoken to in a long time.  It's a dim lit kitchen with warm hues and it was night time.  I was peering in from the door that leads to the backyard.  I saw one of my current coworkers and best friend at the sink, I don't remember what he was doing but he was wearing his normal work clothes and was looking at the sink.  I could hear people in the living room and behind me in the backyard.  I saw that my friend was crying at the sink so I walked up to him cautiously because I know he doesn't like too much attention to his emotions and he doesn't like touch very much.  I went up to him and lightly touched his back and I remember asking him if he needed a hug and he turned to hug me.  He was still crying and I reached to embrace him and I felt wet all of a sudden.  He had turned into water and I was drenched in water.  I remember panicking and turning around frantically to see where he was and what had happened.  I was crying and hyperventilating but couldn't move.  I woke up drenched in sweat and crying.",0,90,85,1,1,1,1,5,1,1,5,3,5,1,1,1,0
Zu16ty,"I walked into a room. It was very dimly lit with a florescent (inconsistent) flickering light, and a girl named Auri was laying there in the middle back wrapped up in a blue quilted blanket on a hospital bed. She's pale, with lash extensions and red/brown hair with blonde highlights. She has a nose piercing. Her left leg was gone. There was a monitor next to her and some black screens on the left side of the wall, but that was it. Her eyes were closed and she was breathing through the ventilator/monitor. The floor was just beige colored tiles, and the room was grey. In real life, Auri was a friend/coworker of mine, but I never had really strong emotions for her until the dream. I was very very very sad she was in the hospital bed, almost as sad as I was when a loved one of mine died. In the dream, I knew that she was going to die. I was never touchy-feely with her in real life, but in my dream I crouched on a red stool next to her and held her hand and touched her forehead and cried while she slept. Then she woke up and chuckled a little bit and asked why I was crying. I told her she was going to die, and she ""no I'm not, I'm fine."" I looked down again and her leg was back and bundled up with the rest of her in her blue blanket. We end up just talking, I don't remember what about, but the conversation is casual and any hesitancy I had towards her in real life was completely gone. A window casually appears on the right side (the East side) of us, and I watch outside. It's dark, and there's a busy road/intersection (the room/hospital is at the corner of the intersection) with bustling cars and all their lights going. The nearby buildings also had lots of lights. It was raining slightly. The road we could see best (going from the North to the South) was inclined, with several little bumps/rolls, with the highest point toward the North side. The cars (normal ones you'd see anywhere) continued to get faster and faster, and we watched as some of them went so fast that they just flew over parts of the hill. I said ""they are starting to get pretty fast."" Some of them begin to drive out of control, as the ones that were flying would land on top of other cars, but the dream acted as if it was normal. Slightly alarming, but normal. More and more cars began to crash, when suddenly cars just began to get launched over from the top of the hill (we couldn't see why they were launching to such a degree). We heard a roar, and suddenly fucking King-Kong appears at the top of the hill and is sweeping cars off the road with his hands and sending them flying. Another giant monster is next to him, but I can't remember what it looked like. I remember starting to feel fear as one of the cars hit out building but didn't break it. We watch King Kong start to descend down the hill, throwing cars everywhere, and realize he's coming towards our building. More cars start hitting our building, when Auri jumps up and grabs my hand at the same time. She's in a white hospital gown with blue and pink mini stars. ""Run!!!"" she shouts, and just as we start to sprint towards what I'm assuming is a door, a car that King-Kong threw hits our room and the ceiling comes crashing in and my dream ends.",17,92,94,2,2,4,1,5,3,1,4,1,5,1,1,1,1
Od25an,"I was at my apartment with my boyfriend and my roommate sent me a Snapchat at 11 pm. I thought it was really weird because she is always in bed and asleep before then. I talked to my boyfriend about how it was weird, and he agreed. Then I walked out of my room and looked in her room and she was gone and her bed was made. So when I saw she was gone I opened her Snapchat and saw that in the background she was at an apartment I had never seen before. I got worried and asked her where she was and then I woke up from my dream. I remember laying in my bed in the dream and feeling warm and when I got up (in my dream) I felt worried. I also remember my roommate's bed being perfectly made like she makes it every morning so it felt really realistic. I mainly felt confused and worried throughout my dream.

I struggle with physical touch in the real world, so holding hands is a big deal for me. I finally grab his hand and just start messing with his hand while we continue talking. He was shocked at first but then carried on the conversation. I remember that his hand was cold but not freezing, more clammy. I also remember the texture of his hands, feeling the indent of the lines on his hands.

Ph11rk,"I was going in to take an exam for school and felt disorientated as I was walking through the halls. The hall in question was a mix of glass windows and painted on green cinder block, but not in a way where they were side by side, but more so that they were partially glass while also partially cinderblock (the best way to describe it is a drink that's clear but also opaque at the same time). If there was any other people there, I don't recall I was focused on taking an exam. From there I would wander for a bit until I got to the hall and began taking the exam. No other people were around me from what I can tell, but the exam was difficult that it prompted me to turn in my sleep(this was observed when I woke up as I was turned 90 degrees from my original sleeping position). However, the contents of the exam from what I could recall were stuff that I had done before in a prior class, but emotionally speaking I felt like it was the hardest thing in the world that I couldn't do and just sat there increasingly frustrated at myself that I wasn't able to do it.

I was on the right side of the bus and there was a couple next to me on the left side of the bus--the orientation of the bus was like a plane. Then, I switched to the left side where the couple was and had my hand out of the window. I almost got it cut off by a wall that was super close but I pulled it back just in time, I didn't feel scared, I felt exhilerated. I then was dropped off somewhere unfamiliar and super open in the city, but I still didn't feel confused. A group of guys were walking toward me and they looked hostile so I ran away and eventually went into a house that only had stairs going towards the attic.

The lighting was a deep shade of red, and there were no over head fluorescent lights at all. There were tons of people there that I had never seen before and the whole time I was trying to find a certain boy. I was very happy and was really enjoying the night. I don't remember speaking at all in this dream but I do remember that there was a basement people were going to using an escalator. This dream was from my own point of view. It seemed as if the only people who really noticed my presence at this party were my own friends. No one was actually doing a particular activity, everyone was just standing around talking to friends and listening to the loud music. At the end of the night I ended up falling asleep on an arm chair after I had found the boy I was looking for.

ha19si,"I was traveling with my ex (my gf at the time), and we were driving across European countryside. It was a long drive, and we were driving through lush green valleys too, but small towns as well. The weather was damp (like Scotland), the vibes were like scotland. We stopped in a small town at this weird building that was like an old inn, but there was no one inside. It seemed like it was too late so the owners of the inn where in the cottage next to the inn. There was a bar inside the inn, but there was barely any light in. I am not sure if it was my sister/gf/mom who did but they went to the bathroom which happened to be right next to the bar table. Somehow, we rested and its almost morning, so we are about to leave and we just get in the car, and the owners(i am guessing), come out of the cottage and see and get angry, but by that time we leave in a rush. Note that, somewhere along this, the number of people increase from just my gf to my mom, sister, and my older brother i think? 
So we leave in the car and try to continue our journey and escape that small town. On the way out of the town, i see a weird man/farmer on the side of the road waiting and just smiling while i drive past him. We drive the rest of the day and then reach this house that we think is a good point to stop. We go upstairs and there's a courtyard that we check out. But suddenly there's a shooter on the neighbours roof trying to shoot us. We all crouch down, but my mom does not. She gets mad at me and disapproves of my decisions, and almost get shot, but my gf pushes my mom so she falls down and gets saved from the shot. (My mother does not approve of me dating a white woman - my gf is white and she cares about my mom which maybe the reason i noticed that in my dream)
We try to leave the house, but as we go back into the living room from the courtyard, there is a baby in a cradle in the middle of the room. Its almost that assasin came and put the baby just to freak us out. We realize that there are people in the house, so we leave immediately, but there is that constant threat. Because I am not supposed to be there. People are after me, and that is why they are trying to hurt people around me as well. 
To me in the dream, I am constantly trying to just make it to some scandinavian country. TO escape to the edge of the world.
My point of view throughout the dream was mostly from an observer point, except when we were at the courtyard.
During the dream, i realized it was an important dream, so i started saving and encoding those incident through categorizing, or using other familiar examples to save them.",40,70,100,3,4,2,3,5,4,3,5,4,4,1,1,1,0

Ka03is,"My dream was about World War 2 and the Holocaust. My family has been in hiding waiting for the war to end. The war wasn't coming close to an end and so my family decided it was safer for us to hide in a forest and escape to a different country where they were accepting Jews. The majority of the dream was in a dark forest in Poland. The forest was wet and muddy due to rainfall and storms, the air felt heavy and it smelled like nature. I heard gunshots, people yelling, screaming, and blaring sirens in the forest. Some People and families had the same idea of hiding and running away through the forest in order to be free from antisemitism. There were different days in the dream, and each day there were fewer and fewer people I saw in the woods because they had either been captured and sent to the concentration camps or were shot and killed in the forest and left there to rot. I had to be careful of where I stepped because I couldn't and didn't want to make a lot of sound in the event that the nazis and guards were right behind me. I remember being out of breath and sweaty most likely because in my dream I was running but also it was anxiety-provoking. I kept waking up hoping that if I woke up it will disturb the dream and I could go back to sleep and dream a new dream, but that wasn't the case. I picked right back up where I left off in my dream. This dream was repeating itself; run and hide, run and hide. At some point in the dream, I tripped over a big log as I was running away from the nazis because they were right behind me. I fell face-first into the mud, and when I raised my head up, I saw a nazi standing over me with a gun pointed at me. My back was propped up on the log and I was shot in the chest. My eyes rolled back and then I woke up. I closed my eyes again and I went back into the part where I left off.

I remember leaving the family room to go upstairs and grab some of my stuff because I was spending the night there. The staircase was mechanically controlled, and I could choose if I wanted to go down the stairs or up the stairs. I chose to go up because that is where my stuff was. I entered the room and was gathering some things when another friend approached me. She asked if I was able to have lunch with them tomorrow and I told her no because I was meeting other friends (this was something that did happen earlier in the day in real life). She follows up asking a question. ""Are we friends?"" At this point, she is standing very close to me. I start to say ""Yes, but..."" and she took a step back. I tried to explain to her that boundaries were something that we needed to discuss between our friendship, and she was really offended by that. She then went around the room (same bedroom upstairs) telling people who had just appeared that I was not a good person. I decided it was time for me to leave the house so I gathered my things, walked down the stairs, and went into the living room. I remember when I entered the living room I reached under the couch that was against the wall and grabbed a box of donuts that I had stashed there earlier. On that same couch, one of my friends was making out with a guy that she had met through one of her classes and has started talking to him. I left the house, which was at the end of a cul-de-sac.

My hair was curly, his two dogs attacked me with kisses like they normally do and he had this longing look when he looked at me. I remember sweating at my palms and nervously playing with my hair, I tick which is very common. I was nervous, It had been a month since we broke up, and I had been struggling to sleep and eat. I hear a soft ""hi"" escape his mouth, something familiar. My heartbeat increased. His hair was longer and disarrayed and had dark circles under his eyes that matched my own. Petting his dog one more time, I say hi back and follow him to his room. The tension was hot, It was awkward and oddly comforting that neither of us knew what to do since we couldn't do the normal routine that we'd practiced for the past year and 3 months of being together. I wanted him. I wanted to feel the warmth of his hug and him fluffing my hair like he used to. But then the other part didn't want me to be there because I couldn't get the bare minimum. I was mad at him, mad at him for not planning dates, holding the door for me, or simply being present. I find myself walking towards him as he sat on his bed, I parted his legs with my own and engulfed him in a hug. I needed that hug and so did he. The smell of Old Spice body wash engulfed me as well. It was comforting, warm, and homey. He too engulfed himself in my fragrance. My Hypnotic Poison by Dior. One that he liked. I feel a warm wet streaking coming down my cheek. I was crying and so was he. I hated seeing him cry, I felt at fault. I felt like I was asking so much, but so little. His hands move from my hips to my upper back, I bend at the hip, looking directly into his eyes. He tilts his head, eyes closed and leans in for a kiss.",59,59,79,2,4,2,1,5,1,2,3,3,3,1,1,1,0
