2,"Okay. So I haven't really been having a lot of dreams or like this, no nightmares really that I can recall. I a lot of times. Don't really remember my dreams lately the last few years, but when I, when I do remember them, it's usually about like, um like child kurdish type stuff and like memories of like my friends and family who have passed away. Like I'll see like uh like my old house that I lived in like mixed up together with like different houses. I lived in mixed up with a bunch of different family members and friends that like aren't here anymore. Or if I'm just starting empire in my life anymore. Um Yeah. remember what happened to. Alright. Like, so like I just can't like, I know, but not really don't have like events that I can recall happening. I just remember just like people in like places like being in like old environments that like made me happy. Like old house, old houses that live in with people and then like different places that we've gone in the world together or just like I just basically, that's what I can remember vividly mostly out of anything I have lately. And yeah,"
3, It has to do with somebody it's the brakes went out on the car. Oh after that somebody had came by me or whatever and um once the brakes went out on the car the car started going without any breaks. And then by the time I woke up if the dream was already over but I keep having like the same dream and like I'm starting to have um like like I was sitting on the curb with a woman and didn't happen today.

She looks up cause the door opens, and she gets killed by the nurse. I kill the nurse in a frantic mode of unbelievable proportio. And I'm running for my life out of the hallway, out of the hospital, and I get hit by an ambulance truck, and I wake up in my bed screaming. No idea how I I don't know how I got there. I wasn't in a bad mood when I went to sleep. I can tell you that is one of the creepiest nightmares I've ever had to deal with because one sec, I was hopefully dreaming happy thoughts, the next  second running for my life and waking up in terror and shock. Was not on my dream agenda. "
9,"You want me to strart now? I was feeling pretty good and then I don't know what it was maybe a dream. I don't know what it was .Then I saw a black cat with green eyes or something. Then he came out of my vent, like the heater, you like where the heat come and all that? It came out there like the like the cat was out the vent. Black cat, came in the dark with green eyes they were like glow in the dark. Yeah it was my dream though nightmare or something like that and then the cat ran back in the vent, like going somewhere. I don't know where it came from or where it at now. And then I laid back down I dozed off (inaudible). Half of them were asleep after I was looking all in the vent everybody was like all enough. Then I look at the clock, It was about 5 in the morning. But I couldn't go back to sleep. I looked in all the vents, I make sure there ain't no cats in there. I was like damn, I was nervous, I swear to god on my life, I was scared. The vent's on the side of the wall. Not on the floor. No,I heard it ran down back in the vent, back in the tunnel. And then when I laid back down it stayed in the vent. (inaudible) and I woke up. "

12,"The same dream I have frequently where I'm  walking and I get out of my car, I go into a store or somewhere and then when I come out I can't find my car. I start panicking and I'm running into different parking lots and streets trying to find my car and I can never find a car. And then I wake up so uneasy."

Ah, it's just a constant repeat of everything that I've been through from the accident to the hospital and it's really starting to just hurt my head and my body every time I have the dreams of jerking in my sleep and it's messing with my leg causing me more pain, it's becoming really uncomfortable and unbearable and I don't know what to do to stop the pain that I get from the nightmares or the headache and it's, it's really starting to be very unbearable and uncomfortable. These are the effects that my dreams are having on me and I can't came to have any other dreams besides to crash, the car crash. Hmm, it's depressing. These are my dreams. This is the effect that it's having on me."
22,"I recently had a dream about my auntie that passed away and today is her birthday and it just maybe for awkward, but it took me back in time, so it was like a happy feeling but sad feeling at the same time. But today I get to spend time with my family so I  don't think about too much bad stuff."

Um He proposed while we were on the beach. We've been talking about getting married, but he told me, You know, give it another year or two and then I didn't have to actually wait the year or two because he proposed. And it was a great feeling, just happiness. I definitely felt myself smiling while I was asleep. You can smell the water, the roses. It was a nice dream."
28,
29,"the setting of the dream is um, the balcony, the door. Well, to the balcony that fell that um was a part of my accident um, stepping out on the balcony and having the balcony, crash, um um there, the nightmare is myself, I have things blocked in front of the door wall that goes to the balcony that's no longer there. And uh uh fear that I'm going to move the um, the furniture and stuff that blocks the balcony and go out on it again. And then there's a flash to the the scene of falling from the balcony, the gray and light gray and a little darker gray um uh visual of falling um just um you know, so the, the fear of, of myself removing the furniture and opening the door wall so I can see the drapery around the door wall. I can see the furniture that blocks the door wall. But the fear that um, I'll open the door while during my sleep, is that, is this dream? Um it's it's only me. I don't see other people in it. Um The feeling is just um there's no smell or taste or touch, but the visual is again, this screen of um gray, light gray and dark gray like that I saw at the accident as I'm falling with the balcony. Um um that's about all I remember. Okay"

35,"Recently I had a traumatic experience. My house caught on fire. And Now I had a dream. Mhm. About that day because I could  have lost my life and trying to fight to get out the house and smoke. Yeah, I saw myself not doing too well."
36,"Okay, so this dream happened I'd say a week ago. Um the day is currently the 26. Um The setting of the dream was the reason I went into the er I remember being in the car with my boyfriend um at the time, you know, I remember I was confused, I remember feeling confused as to why am I in this position again? And then I remember seeing his face and seeing the building once again and I already knew what was going to happen and I wanted to jump out the car. I wanted to jump out the car so badly and it's like the car just got faster and faster and faster, yet the building seemed so far away. But I know it wasn't but I seen and felt so far away and we're just going fast and I'm just trying to think of a way I'm like, I know I'm gonna get my legs broken, so how do I fix this situation? I'm looking for the emergency brake, I can't find it. I'm thinking, should I run out the car, should I jump out the car right now? Should I jump into the back seat and see if that'll affect anything? Maybe I will be safer in the back seat. I was trying to take off my seatbelt but I couldn't and I was I was very scared and unpleasant honestly, just seeing that building and then feeling the crash all over again. I felt so much anxiety because I knew what was about to happen, I can still smell the gas from the car, I can smell the smoke, I can see the smoke. I feel everything from my back. I remember holding my breath and feeling like something was squishing me like I felt squished and I remember turning to my head to the left and seeing my boyfriend knocked out with blood and it was it was very traumatic for me just in that moment and I started crying and then I woke up out of my dream."

49,"I had a dream about driving in a vehicle but then kept realizing that I was very distracted and I was actually in the back seat of the vehicle at times and then I kept having to try to remember to steer the vehicle and then it was gonna crash off the road. I kept having to get back into the front seat to steer when I was distracted by something else in the vehicle and I'm not sure why I was never in control, so I felt like I was in danger, but not really, and everything was kind of out of control. It was pretty obscure, I think at times there's someone in the vehicle with me but I I can't recall who or why, sorry, So vague, but it's kind of easy other than driving a vehicle, but not actually being in control of operating it and to constantly keep correcting the course it's on. But continuing to just be a passenger as well."

It was a lot and basically represents what's going on now."
