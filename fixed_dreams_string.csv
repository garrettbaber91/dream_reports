I was fighting with my boyfriend and went home for christmas break to see him and all my friends
"I was with some people I do not know celebrating. There was a balcony over the side of a cliff that was very dangerous. People were doing stunts on the balcony (walking on their hands on the railing, etc) while everyone watched and cheered. Then someone fell, but it turns out there was a grassy hill not far down below that they safely landed on and seemingly planned to do so. Everyone cheered, and then everyone jumped down onto the hill to play these weird extreme sports, like tossing objects into the air and someone else shooting them down with a bow and arrow. There was a row of minifridges with drinks in them, one of them was mine. My parents showed up at the end to get me and my dad was having trouble moving my minifridge. That's all I remember."

"I think that this dream occurred in the past, like shortly after the time planes were invented, but I was like somehow aware it was not safe. I was forced to get on this sketchy plane to go somewhere, but I was the only one who was freaking out since I knew it was dangerous. We started going up in the air and the plane started shaking."

"It's recurring i remember having it a few times before but slightly different each time. It's my friends house in real life but in the dream it was very strange and is called the ""green room"" (even though its a house idk). From what I remember last night my friends were there with me and they kept getting killed by something, there was a woman in a white dress and distorted face, and then eventually before leaving the house my dad was in a chair and said ""hey"" but when he swiveled around he had no legs."
"I flew in to Maine for some reason with many friends and family. Went to a seafood restaurant and was not wearing shoes. After, the restaurant was connected to a bar and large conference room where all of my friends were. I saw a very old friend"
